Triangular desire, or mimetic desire, the precursor to mimetic theory,
is a model of understanding human desire.  It is fundamentally simple,
and states that a subject copies the desires of his model.

In the literay terms of 'Deceit, Desire, and the Novel,' it refers to
the "self" copying the desire of the "other."

Girard refers to these copied desires as *metaphysical desires*.
Fundamentally, the subject's desire is aimed at appropriating the
being of the Other.  The object which appears to be desired is only a
means of reaching the mediator (Other).

> Every hero of a novel expects his being to be radically changed by
  the act of possession.

Through the analysis of literature Girard arrives at what he calls the
novelistic revelation: the existence of metaphysical desire.

The necessity of this revelation in the novelistic universe is
important.  Since the object is not the actual aim of desire, it's
acquisition ultimately results in disappointment.  The fruits of
metaphysical desire are bitter in general.  The expected
transformation doesn't take place when the object is acquired.

The model of triangular desire allows the analyst to examine
novelistic works and relate the structure and results of the
metaphysical desire in a systematic fashion.  Girard does this and
structures his analyis of the works in a fashion exploring the spread
of the ongological sickness (the increasing proximity of the mediator)
through a review of literature termed "novels of mediated desire."

Following the novelistic revalation, the novelistic conclusion, at
least with regards to "novels of mediated desire," end with the
renunciation of metaphysical desire.  The hero repudiates his
mediator, and a new relationship with the self and others is born.
This result can take any number of forms, typically however it
resembles the hero adopting solitude, or rejoining society with a new
outlook.

Inherent in Girard's reasoning is that we all operate under the guise
of a model.  In Girard's reasoning true freedom lies in the choice
between a human or divine model.  As Girard puts it in the first
chapter: *The aesthetic emotion is not desire, but the ending of all
desire, a return to calm and joy.*

The novelistic revelation of the existence of metaphysical desire, and
it's ultimate result of suffering and slavery, is not dissimilar from
many spiritual teachings.  Such as in Buddhism - desire and ignorance
lie at the root of suffering.

What triangular desire allows the critic to do is to reveal the
structure of metaphysical desire and it's operation in a systematic
method.  In a way, through the use of literature (and later religious
texts and cultural analysis), it confirms aspects of what can be
referred to as religious or spirtual teaching.  In a round-about way,
Girard uses literature and triangular desire as a way of revealing 

As a model of analysis it also reveals errors in conventional thought,
and poses serious questions about the nature of individuality and
equality.  What does it mean to be passionate? Or vain?  Is there
ultimately a difference?

The presence of the mediator distorts the subject's sense of reality.
For example, the barber's basin which Don Quixote takes to be
Mambrino's helmet.  Quixote's mediator, his perfect model of chivalry,
Amadis of Gaul, through which Quixote's reality is transfigured,
results in the hilarious escapades of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

But who, ultimately, is to say that Don Quixote is a madman?
Quixote's model is clear, he reveals his imitation of Amadis of Gaul,
the perfect mirror of chivalry, the essensce of knight-errantry.  But
while Quixote is a madman, the characters who follow him around in his
adventures and enchantments are the sane -- grounded in reality.
Beside's Sancho and his desire to govern an island (which comes from
Quixote), the other character's mediators are not as clearly sourced.

Girard begins his analyis of metaphysical desire with Quixote in
*Deceit, Desire, and the Novel,* likely because Quixote confirms the
model easily.  There is no question that Quixote's desires are the
desires of Amadis of Gaul.
