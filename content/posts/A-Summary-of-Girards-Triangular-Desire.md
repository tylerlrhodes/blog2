Triangular desire, aka mimetic desire, the precursor to mimetic theory,
is a model of understanding human desire.  It is fundamentally simple,
and states that a subject copies the desires of his model.

In the literary terms of *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel (DDATN),* it
refers to the "self" copying the desire of the "other."

With the model of triangular desire it is possible to form an analysis
of human behavior through literature and other forms.  While
triangular desire is reductive in application, it's power as a model
comes from it's simplicity.

Girard refers to these copied, or imitated desires, as *metaphysical
desires*.  He is not referring definitively to all "desire," but
rather to desires which do not originate from the Self, desires which
originate from an Other and cannot be fulfilled by the Self.
Fundamentally, the subject's (mimetic) desire is aimed at
appropriating the being of the Other.  The object which appears to be
desired is only a means of reaching the mediator (Other).

The base example Girard uses in DDATN is Don Quixote, whose case is
most obvious.  Don Quixote imitates his model of chivalry, Amadis of
Gaul, in his effort to practice the essence of knight-errantry.
Further works exposing the operations of metaphysical desire are less
obvious.  Not every hero declares his model, or character his
role-model.

Girard separates the operation of the mediation of desire primarily
into the categories of *internal* and *external* mediation.  The two
categories refer to the distance of the mediator from the subject in a
"spiritual sense." Don Quixote's imitation of Amadis of Gaul, or a
Christian's imitation of Christ, are examples of external mediation.
His other examples (works I haven't read) are more examples of
internal mediation: *The Red and the Black*, *Notes From the
Underground*, *The Past Recaptured*, and so on.  The mediator in these
works is more close than far.

Through triangular desire and the characteristic *double mediation* of
*internal mediation* it is possible to represent complex forms of
behavior and emotion from a base analysis of desire.  The deceptive
complexity of behavior becomes simple with the exposition of
metaphysical desire in literature.

Inherent in triangular desire is the transfiguration of the object.
The object increases or decreases in "metaphysical value" based upon
the mediator.  Complicating the analysis at times is the vague notion
of what the "object" can be. Don Quixote is a comedy through his
tormentor's enchantments, and a barber's basin becomes Mambrino's
helmet. More *real* examples, found in internal mediation, manifest
differently despite the same base operation.  In internal mediation,
the object loses its importance in the analysis as the mediator draws
near.

Girard explores vanity, snobbism, masochism, sadism, and
individuality, through the lens of triangular desire, revealing the
(ironic) equivalence of Quixote's transfigured barber's basin as
helmet to the common snob's behavior.  The mechanism is the same, but
the distance to the mediator results in the difference of perception
and ultimately behavior.

While I would think that most people would not assert the fundamental
equivalence of passion and vanity, that is what Girard's model does.
All is dependent upon the distance from the mediator. Perception,
behavior, and reality (which springs from illusion) in Girard's model
arise from metaphysical desire. Modeling reality from literature (in
the beginning was the Word...) and claiming it springs from illusion
requires some nuance, as there is a \*physical\* reality obviously.
But it would be foolish to think that that the metaphysical does not
impact the physical in many ways.

With an understanding of the mediation of desire, and *double
mediation,* it appears to be possible to understand a modeling of the
roots of emotions and behaviors prevalent within contemporary life.

The operations of double mediation (A copies the desire of B, B in
turn copies the desire of A) conceal the nature of the model
through the subjects denial of their admiration and imitation.  The
hated rival is in fact in some ways an admired model and double
mediation plunges its victims into the abyss of rivalry.  As the
distance to the mediator decreases, the potential for rivalry
increases, the deceit and duplicity grows, and the results of double
mediation grow worse.

Double mediation, and internal mediation, result in a perpetual
copying of desire.  Each desire begets a duplicate desire, and through
this a rivalry can emerge.  

Don Quixote and Amadis of Gaul are not rivals due to their "distance."
Sancho's desire to govern an island is suggested by Quixote, but they
still are not rivals -- they operate in separate lanes of metaphysical
reality.  Their mediation is external and doesn't result in rivalry.

Contrast the same mediation of desire under the internal modeling,
such as in *The Tale of the Inappropriate Curiosity*, included within
Don Quixote by Cervantes, and the same mediation, operating between
"friends" in the context of "love," has a vastly different appearance
and outcome: the death of Anselmo, instead of the comedy of the
windmills.

Deviated transcendency, the inversion of vertical transcendency, the
imitation of the false idol instead of the divine, has diabolical
consequences.

Anselmo schemes to have his "friend" Lotario seduce his wife in a vain
effort to validate her virtue in the "expected" case of her denying
Lotario's advances.  The outcome is different however, and Anselmo's
offering to Lotario, instead of frustrating his rival, validating his
desire, and affirming his wife's virtue, results in a "successful
seduction" and Anselmo's downfall.

Double mediation, in operation between the "friends," rears it's ugly
head in this case.  Anselmo's desires become Lotario's desires and
vice versa, and the originally hidden rivalry becomes apparent and
it's conclusion tragic instead of comic.

The inclusion of the tale within *Don Quixote* according to Girard
shows the operation of *internal mediation.* Girard's take is that
Cervantes included it to show the universal nature of metaphysical
desire.  Girard states that the hero of internal mediation offers his
"sacrifice" to the god in order that the god might not enjoy it.
Here, Anselmo pushes his beloved into his mediator's arms in order to
arouse his desire and triumph over the rival mimetic (imitated)
desire. Anselmo's plan fails however and leads to his downfall.

The imitative nature of the working of desire has been expanded upon
by others.  In a later work of Girard's, *Things Hidden Since the
Foundation of the World*, one of the interviewers, a psychiatrist,
Jean-Michel Oughourlain, analyzes mimetic theory with Girard.  This
doctor goes on to incorporate this model of desire into his practice
of psychiatry and medicine, offering credence to the concept of
imitative desire and its operation in internal and double mediation.
In his book, *The Mimetic Brian*, he goes so far as to "tweak" desire
to the benefits of his patients.

The realm of internal mediation as explored by Girard is brutal and
total.  Don Quixote's comic chivalric exploits make us laugh.  But the
works of Dostoevsky and Proust (apparently, I have yet to read them,
but I found nothing that obviously contradicts Girard's model in Don
Quixote) display the tyranny of internal mediation.  The model can be
anybody and spring up at any time.  The reign of each short but awful.
The tragic becomes the comic, and the comic the tragic, and the
operations of desire make deceit and hypocrisy the rule of the day.

Double mediation seems to make the same invent difference, while
paradoxically eliminating it (*Violence and the Sacred* speaks more on
"difference").  The very notions of consciousness and individuality,
and the tenets of Western thought, are exposed and laid bare.  As
Buddhism says, suffering is rooted in desire and ignorance.  Girard's
model, and the display through literature of its veracity, appears to
confirm this truth within a context of Western literature.

Metaphysical desire is contagious and Girard terms it's spread as the
*ontological disease.*  In DDATN Girard explores the progression of
the disease through contemporary time with an exploration of
literature.

Girard claims that literature is reflective of the stages of the
ontological disease and the novelists' awareness of this
reality. According to Girard, despite the apparent gulf between *Don
Quixote*, *Notes From the Underground,* and other works he discusses,
the novels all perform the same act ultimately: they reveal the
existence of metaphysical desire.  Girard calls this the *novelistic
revelation.*

In *Don Quixote,* this operation is fairly obvious.  Don Quixote's
imitation of Amadis of Gaul and his chivalric exploits in practicing
knight-errantry are absurd and comic.  Through the mediation Don
Quixote participates in, the "common" reality shared by the priest,
various innkeepers, Dukes, and others, is contrasted with the absurd
enchantments Don Quixote experiences.

The *novelistic revelation* is performed by contrasting metaphysical
realities.  In the case of *Don Quixote,* this is pretty easy to see.
The contrast between the books of chivalry which form the basis for
Don Quixote's reality, and the reality of the priest, for example, is
a relatively straight forward.

Through a contrast of the realities of the characters within the novel,
a process *suggested* implicitly, not explicitly, the malleable nature
of metaphysical reality and desire becomes apparent.  Coupled with the
model of triangular desire, many apparent "complexities," "archetypes,"
and other notions become reducible within the literature itself to the
same fundamental operation: the mediation of desire.

The absurdity of Don Quixote's enchantments become comic not out of
some fixed "true reality" of which he alone is excluded and truly
insane within in an absolute sense.  They are absurd and comic because
of the incompatible realities shared by the characters (and readers)
and the conflicting transfiguration of reality.  

By exploring a number of novels, Girard reveals that the ultimate
result of metaphysical desire is enslavement, shame, and suffering.
Don Quixote's desires are not his own, and while his exploits are
hilarious, nobody would wish them upon themself.  The tyranny under
which the underground man toils is driven by the same mediation, only
his mediator(s) are closer than Quixote's Amadis of Gaul.  While
the underground man's "reality" may be more "real" to us than
Quixote's, the path to each is the same.

Despite the tyranny of metaphysical desire, there is a freedom
achieved through what Girard calls the *novelistic conclusion.*  This
occurs when the hero renounces his old self.  The hero renounces
metaphysical desire, realizes the nature of his desire, and is able to
rejoin the world with a new relation to others and reality.  This
conclusion may manifest differently but is fundamentally the same.

Don Quixote abandons knight-errantry and the folly of his ways in the
end.  Don Quixote's freedom comes ironically at the point of his death
in the novel.

Freedom, seen through the Girardian lens, is in the renunciation of
metaphysical desire, and the selection of a divine model instead of a
human model.

The study of metaphysical desire as undertaken in DDATN is important
due to the outcome of its mediation.  The mediation of desire, and the
ontological sickness (the increasing proximity of the mediator),
ultimately lead to shame, slavery, and suffering.

The novelistic revelation, and the exposure of the existence of
metaphysical desire seems to validate certain "spiritual lessons,"
such as in Buddhism.  It also validates the Christian's imitation of
Christ, and undoubtedly other religious teachings.

The model of triangular desire allows the analyst to examine
novelistic works and relate the structure and results of the
metaphysical desire in a systematic fashion.  Girard does this and
structures his analysis by exploring the spread of the ontological
sickness through a review of literature termed "novels of mediated
desire."

The necessity of this revelation in the novelistic universe is
important.  Since the object is not the actual aim of desire, it's
acquisition ultimately results in disappointment.  The fruits of
metaphysical desire are bitter in general.  The expected
transformation doesn't take place when the object is acquired.

Girard's analysis rests on the idea we all operate under the guise of
a model.  In Girard's reasoning true freedom lies in the choice
between a human or divine model.

As Girard puts it in the first chapter: *The aesthetic emotion is not
desire, but the ending of all desire, a return to calm and joy.*
