title: "Updated Blog Layout"

Well I've been blogging for nearly a year now.  My journey into
blogging started with building a blog engine in ASP.NET Core and
Entity Framework Core.  However I did very little blogging on that
engine because I spent most of my time building it.

However, writing about building that blog engine helped me get my
current job apparently, so I'm convinced that blogging and writing on
the internet can have an upside.

But since I moved over to Hugo and a statically generated site hosted
on S3 and CloudFront, the overhead to writing and publishing has been
greatly reduced and I'm no longer tempted to just tweak the blog
engine.  It's also cheaper.  This blog literally costs less than two
dollars a month.

But I decided that it was time to give the site a little bit of an
update.  The previous layout was nice and I focused on just writing
and trying to get better at writing, but I started to dislike the
landing page.  I felt I needed a concise summary of myself for random
people who find me on the internet.

So now, when people visit [tylerrhodes.net](https://tylerrhodes.net)
they get assaulted with a nice picture of me as I'm about to eat
lobster.  Followed by a blurb which I'll probably update because its
ridiculous and then the most recent blog entries and social media
links.

I'm starting to think a little strategically about what I can use
this site for to grow my career and do more of the type of work I want
to do.

Early in my career I was doing more integrations and consulting
work, which involved lots of different projects and clients.  At times
it was stressful, but I learned a lot, and fast.

My last two jobs moved from that environment to internal software
engineering roles where I've learned on the job and on my own.  But
working on the same thing everyday can get really boring, and if the
environment isn't progressive it can get tedious.

Instead of learning new systems and processes day in and day out and
being exposed to a lot of different things, you deal with the same
thing - everyday.  That's not to say that there aren't some technical
challenges, but there are far fewer.  While it's nice to be able to
work with the same people everyday, eventually it starts to feel like
you're in the movie Groundhogs Day.

So the conclusion I'm coming to is that I tentatively think I'd like
to move to a consulting/freelance arrangement, potentially on my own.
Which means I need to be able to find clients, do marketing and sales,
and so on.  Not exactly my strong suit.  I'd also like to be able to
do a lot of work remotely.  This would enable me to expand my customer
base outside of my immediate geographical area.

All of this means I need to do a number of things which involve
marketing.  I also need to pick one or two things to specialize in, so
that people will pay me and I can charge a good sum.  I also need
to start doing some networking, probably across technical disciplines
to enable me to reach out to other experts for things I can't or don't
want to do.

So anyway, because all of this is at least a year away, I'm going to
keep learning what I'm learning.  I'm going to master SQL Server and
.NET programming.  It's one thing to be reasonably good at it, it's
definitely another to master it.

I'm going to get stronger at SEO and marketing and build up a strategy
for driving some traffic to the blog while I learn more about the
independent consulting and freelance market so I can figure out the
ideal traffic to drive to the site.

I've actually started to get up early and get work done before I get
home from work when all I want to do is sit and watch Netflix and do
nothing.  Which is encouraging, because I've got a few blog posts
going on and I'm making good progress through some challenging books.
I've also got a plan for getting back to SICP and finishing that, but
with Clojure and not Scheme.

So anyway, it's time to get cracking.
