Lately, when I read something I get really interested in, I have the
tendency to read it semi quickly, and then, go back and read it again
to dig in a little bit deeper.

Reinhold Niebuhr's works are books that kind of strike this chord
within me.  Niebhur is a theologian who was well regarded and popular
becoming known as a public intellectual who was also famous for a
number of books.  This book, *The Children of Light and The Children
of Darkness,* was first published in 1944, shortly before the end of
World War II.

It is one of those books that I will be returning to after having read
it, along with a number of his other works which are also highly
interesting and relevant, despite being outdated by a number of years
now.

First, the book is intellectually grasping in a way that many books
aren't.  It also portrays the world, while within the context of
religion to some extent, in realistic terms both socially and
politically in a way which I feel was important to be exposed to.

> Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible; but man's
  inclination towards injustice makes democracy necessary.

This is a quote from the forward to the first edition of the book, and
also a quote highlighted on the back flap of the copy I own.

It's a quote that aligns well with the thrust of a lot of Neibuhr's
writing, at least the parts I've read, and provides an good context
for reading this and other non-technical/scientific works.

After reading a bit of Niebuhr and also Rene Girard, this statement,
and also this work was and is interesting to me because there is a
dialectic between their two works which resonates in a way for me
personally dealing with the world today.
