I will say that you should definitely read *Don Quixote* by Cervantes.
You should put your other reading plans on hold, quit your job, skip
meals, neglect your responsibilities, and read the story of Don
Quixote as soon as possible.

My normal go-to "favorite book" that I usually dredge up when
occasionally asked is *Jurassic Park* by Michael Crichton, but *Don
Quixote* is a serious contender now to take its place.

I like to think that I've read some good books so far in my life,
ranging from the highly literary work of Stephen King and John Grisham
to cheap thrillers like *For Whom the Bell Tolls.* *Don Quixote* tops
all of them for me.  It was an incredibly fun book to read.  The fact
that a novel written hundreds of years ago is as funny as it is says
something about how good a work it is.

Hands down it is the funniest book I have ever read.  I can't even
think of anything that comes close, maybe *Breakfast of Champions* by
Vonnegut?  It's kind of rare to read a book that has you laughing the
whole way through, but *Don Quixote* is that book.

It tells the story of Don Quixote, who, having read countless tales of
knight-errantry and chivalry, takes up the task to defend the helpless
in the name of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso.  Sancho Panza, Don
Quixote's squire, taken in by the promise of becoming the governor of
an island, shares in the adventures and enchantements.

And the enchantments are many:

> 'Look here, Sancho,' said Don Quixote, 'I swear to you by the same
  oath you have just sworn to me that you are the most dim-witted
  squire there ever was.  Is it possible that in all the time you have
  been with me you have failed to realize that all things appertaining
  to us knights errant seem like chimeras, follies, and nonsenses,
  because they have all been turned on their head?  Not because that
  is their real state, but because we are always attended by a crew of
  enchanters who keep transforming everything and changing it into
  whatever they like, according to whether they have a mind to help us
  or destroy us; and so what looks to you like a barber's basin looks
  to me like Mambrino's helmet and will look like something else to
  another person.  And the sage who is on my side showed rare
  foresight in making everyone take what is really and truly
  Mambrino's helmet for a barber's basin, because Mambrino's helmet is
  so highly esteemed that everyone would otherwise have pursued me to
  try to take it from me...'

Through nearly 1000 pages we're treated to these enchantments as Don
Quixote and Sancho Panza pursue their most noble mission of
knight-errantry.  

It's a great read.  I didn't know a book could be this funny.
