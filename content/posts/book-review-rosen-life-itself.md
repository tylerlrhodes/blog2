description: "Book review for the scientific work 'Life Itself' by
Robert Rosen, a work exploring what an organism is from the standpoint
of theoretical biology."
---


*Life Itself,* by Robert Rosen, was a book I picked up by chance based
upon the recommendation of somebody I follow on Twitter who is
involved with Complex Systems, a topic that I find interesting.
Now, since I have finished reading it, I've totally forgotten why it
was recommended or what context it was recommended within, but
nevertheless, I finished it and enjoyed it.  Oh right, the Complex
Systems part!

It's was definitely a stretch for me to read.  I didn't expect quite
as much math as there was in the book, despite the fact that nearly
all of it you can work out fairly simply as you go along.  The hardest
part in the beginning was following the notation, since I have not
done "math" for a long time, and never really knew all of my Greek
alphabet.  But by the end of the book I knew a Sigma and a Phi better
than when I started.

I should have been less surprised than I was at the math to be
honest.  The math turns out to be necessary, or at least the notation
and formality with which Rosen uses to make his case.  While the book
is philosophical in nature, it is also precise in it's goal --
providing a scientific answer to what "life" is.  The mathematical
notation and models that Rosen builds are key to his answer.

The book was really something I enjoyed reading even though it was a
hard read.  While I may not have gotten the math as well as possible,
I feel like I understood 90% of it or so.  There is one chapter on
"state" and recursivity, which I thought was trickier than the others,
but mostly because of the derivative analogies.  It's been too long
since I have thought about a derivative, and differential equations
are beyond what I ever got to.

However, while the rest of the math in the book took some serious
concentration for me to get initially, by the end I was working through
the notation much more easily than in the early chapters.  I didn't really
expect 'Category Theory' to play a role in this book, but Rosen
explains it and the notation doesn't really get too complicated.

While I would butcher the position of Rosen's "Life Itself," if I was
to try to explain it technically, I totally got behind his ultimate
take, which is that an organism is not equal to a machine by itself.
In fact most of the book is building up in a formal manner to this
compelling conclusion.  Rosen spends a long time showing how machines
and mechanisms are modeled in a formal manner, and why this is
fundamentally incompatible with modeling an organism.

He puts it as follows in the end, in perhaps his most concise take:

> A material system is an organism, if and only if, it is closed to
  efficient causation.

Throughout the book we are introduced to Gödel's Theory, and later, to
Alan Turing's work as Rosen builds up his critique of where the
metaphors of machine and mechanism fail to describe life in an
adequate sense.  In the end he argues that an organism cannot be
described syntactically in the same way as a machine.  Helping
understand this of course is the book.

While I am not a scientist, the fact that life and organism as machine
is the prevailing metaphor used to describe it by the sciences is
something that is not lost on me.  It was heartening to find Rosen's
final take and his position that the *soma*, or what is alive, is more
than can be defined by the syntax of a machine.  His book explains
this position wonderfully.

In addition to critiquing the contemporary "life as machine" metaphor
prevalant within science, Rosen offers a potential new idea or model
for biology in describing and studying life, that of, "Relational
Biology."  I won't attempt to go into it here, but the book does, and
it is founded on how the mechanistic model cannot successfully
describe an organism through reduction.

Also fascinating is his comparison of the so-called "hard" and "soft"
sciences and the reasoning behind this.  Deriving this difference and
drawing a parallel to Gödel's Theorem made for interesting reading
early on in the book, and set the stage for the rest of the text.

Overall if you are up for a challenging read this is a very good book.
Rosen is a great writer, and while the math is challenging, and
required to understand the book, if you're up to it, you may come
away with an inspiring read concerning life, and how it's more than
the machine metaphor commonly given can offer.
