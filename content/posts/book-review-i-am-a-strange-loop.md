*I Am a Strange Loop*, is a book by Douglas Hofstadter concerning the
nature of the self.




In it Hofstadter explores what he considers to be the experience of
the "I", or self, and how this experience is constructed from a
self-referential loop of sorts -- his *strange loop*.


Through the text Hofstadter uses any number of metaphors and "thought
experiments" to drive home his loop.  Or I think that this is what
he's doing.

There are a few spots I think he drives home this core message, and
that's in his exposition of Kurt Godel's work concerning *Principia
Mathematica*, and how he showed that an entire system designed and
constructed to eliminate self-reference, was actually
self-referential.

Hofstadter does a great job of showing this, even for someone like
myself who hasn't really done math for a while.  It's pretty clever
how it works,  and the story behind it.  It's these few chapters that
get me really excited about reading *Godel, Escher, Bach*.

While I believe that I agree with the core premise of the book, that
is, the *strange loop* is the experience of the self, I wasn't
really crazy about the book itself.  Which is disappointing, because I
am looking forward *still* to reading *Godel, Escher, Bach* by the
same author.

I didn't like the book mainly because of the writing style.  As much
as this book is about the *strange loop*, it's also about Hoftstadter,
his opinions, and his life.  I mean, I am basically in agreement with
just about everything he says in the books.  But I lost interest
hearing what I think could be considered pseudo-scientific
rationalizations of certain aspects of spirituality.
