Girard's model of Triangular Desire is used throughout 'Deceit, Desire
& the Novel,' (DDATN), to analyze a number of texts, revealing
characteristics of human behavior through the analysis of fictional
characters.

Using this model, Girard explores how what he calls "novels of
mediated desire" reveal the existance of metaphysical desire.  His
model of triangular desire is essentially a model which can be used
to analyze the works to confirm the revalation.

Operating under the context of triangular desire, the individual has
surrendered his fundamental perogative, he no longer chooses his
desires.  His desires are the desires of his mediator.

Girard builds his model of triangular desire from the words of Don
Quixote, and Quixote's imitation of his model of chivalry, Amadis of
Gaul.  With this foundation he couples Quixote and later works to the
model of triangular desire.

Triangular desire results in a mediation between subject and model.
While not necessarily bad, in certain forms it results in a rivalry
betwen the subject and his mediator.

Girard's analysis of texts in DDATN examines the results of this
mediation based upon essentially the distance between the mediator and
subject.  The core message driven throughout is that the closer the
mediator, the greater the chance of rivalry, and the bitterer the
result of rivalry.




Inherent in this foundation when considered outside the context of
fictional work, is a more profound question of course, however within
the context of DDATN, we are free to explore using the model of
triangular desire.

The *desire* that Girard speaks of is what he refers to as
*metaphysical desire,* and in general I think it would be a mistake to
reduce Girard's ideas to nonsense because of some reasoning along the
lines of "I just want the cookie because it tastes good, not because
the Cookie Monster suggested this desire to me."

Girard states that the novelist's fundamental concern is not the creation
of characters but the revelation of metaphysical desire.


DDATN hints at this deductive process to come, sketching the framework
of analysis which will be used in *Violence and the Sacred.*

Oh, Girard's analysis of human life and culture, is probably the most
insightful analysis of anything I've ever read, but it is not
inherently filled with optimism.  His last work, 'Battling to the
End,' seems to conclude with the message of: welcome to the
apocolapyse.

The irony and beauty put on display by Girard in the reduction of the
complexity of life to a simple axiom is incredible.  And his method of
exposition by using literatur and texts genrally accepted to be the
best of the best is brilliant.  I'm sure my mind has been warped as
much as Don Quixote's in reading it, but I'll try to keep my madness
to myself.

The best part of Girard's work?  It proves itself.  Every trace of it
is revealed, there is no monkey business, no advanced math, and if you
follow it through, it's really really hard to brush aside.  Girard
himself shows that he didn't invent a thing.  Unlike the English
teachers you had in school, Girard actually shows how to read
something.

I mean, what is also fun, is that there is what I guess some people
would call "real science" to back up this theory.  Oh the insanity
that will come about when "real science" shows that the Bible had it
right all along.  I'll buy popcorn I guess to that show.  If you're
really bored look up mirror neurons.

It's like Forrest Gump said all along: "stupid is as stupid does."


Chapter 1: "Triangular" desire

* Once the mediators influence is felt, the sense of reality is lost
  and judgement paralyzed.
* Passion vs Vanity: what does it mean to desire? Is passion the
  opposite of vanity?  individualism?
* "The passionate person draws the strength of his desire from within
  himself and not from others" - passion / vanity (passion in
  Stendhal)
* A vaniteux will desire any object so long as he is convinced that it
  is already desired by another person whom he admires.  The mediator
  here is a rival, brought into existence as a rival by vanity, and
  that same vanity demands his defeat.  
* External vs internal mediation: the existance of the rival and
  spiritual distance to the mediator
* Double mediation: a desire begets a duplicate desire, and a rival
  * the mediator can no longer act his role of model without also
    acting or appearing to act the role of obstacle.
* The loathed rival is actually a mediator    
* Start with the rival instead of the object of desire for analysis,
  the mediator transfigures the object
* Jealousy, envy, hatred: traditional names given to internal
  mediation
* the most fervent imitation is the most denied
* vanity transforms the object
* in the birth of desire, the third person is always prsent
* psychological analysis = analysis of vanity / triangular desire
* internal mediation is a dissolving power, striking at the core of
  groups and family
* snob - p24, doesn't trust his own judgement, only others -- slave to
  fashionable, only desires objects desired by others
* Closer the mediator gets to subject, the mmore the possibilities of
  the two rivals merge, and the more insuperable the obstacle becomes
* highest forms of suggesstion not as different from the lowest as we
  belive, distance btw Don Quixote and advertising not as big as led
  to believe
* the aesthetic emotion is not desire, but the ending of all desire, a
  return to calm and jow
* process of mediation creates the appearance of spontaneousness and
  autonomous behavior when in fact there is none
* "recapturing the past" = destruction of one's pride
* proust asserts the equivalance of desire, hate, envy, love, jealousy
* inevitable consequence of desire copied from another desire are
  "envy, jealousy, impotent hatred"
* closer the mediator, the more bitter the fruit of triangular desire
* closer the mediator, the greater his role, and the smaller the role
  of object
  - sometimes only vestiges of an object
* deception of the hero is claiming the independence of his desire
  (internal vs external - Don Quixote cleary shows source of desire)
* "Triangular desire is one"
* hero desires only that which will frustrate his mediator
* The real "Don Juan" is not autonomous, he is incapable of doing
  without others
*

Chapter 2: Men become Gods in the eyes of each other

* Every hero of a novel expects his being to be radically changed by
  the act of possession.
* The object is only a means of reaching the mediator.  The desire is
  aimed at the mediators being.
* This can take the form of a desire to be initiated into a new "life"
  or "lifestyle" - p53
* The desiring subject wants to become his mediator - "perfect
  knight", "irresistible seducer"
* The curse the hero is burdened with is indistinguishable from his
  subjectivity.
* What is the source of demands the self cannot satisfy?
  * a desire originating in the self, should be satisfieable by the
  self
  * These desires (metaphysical desire) don't originate from teh self
  * false promise of metaphysical autonomy: Dostoyevsky
* "God is dead, man must take his place": "new" Western Doctrine - p56
* As the voice of pride swells, the consciousness of existence becomes
  bitter and solitary
* Everyone thinks that he alone is condemned to hell, and that is what
  makes it hell: "I am alone, and they are together."
* An individual proclaims that he does not wish to change his being
  and that he is self-sufficient: the victims of modern gospel are its
  greatest allies.  The more one becomes a slave the more one defends
  slavery.
* Choice involves choosing a model, and true freedom lies in the
  choice between a human or divine model
* pride is more external to us than the external world
* Hate is the reverse image of divine love
* The false prophets proclaim that in tomorrow's world "men will be
  gods for each other."
* The passion that drives men to seize or gain more possessions is not
  materialistic: it is the triumph of the mediator, the god with the
  human face
* Vanity prevents the addmission of failure, characters cannot equal
  the model they have chosen.
* modern historical development and the appeal of "political freedom"
  give rise or heighten vanity
* "We shall never despise the snob as much as he despises himself"
* p67 - "moral judgement", we don't have the heart to condem one who
  is "possessed"
* snobbism begins with equality
* we condomen one and forgive the other on the same moral grounds
* one must be a snob oneself to suffer from the snobbism of others
* as the distance between subject and mediator decreases, differences
  diminish, the comprehension more acute and the hatred more intense
* the lucidity and blindness both increase as the mediator comes
  nearer
* It is those who are most inclined to the "ontological sin" that
  attempt to cure Don Quixote
* It is always the most familiar forms of imitative desire which
  excite indignation
* the metaphor should reveal the significance of metaphysical desire
* The narrator always approaches his god in fear and trembling
* A childhood deprived of the sacred succeeds in ressurecting myths
  which have been dead for centuries; it revivifies the most lifeless
  symbols
* metaphysical life is so vigorours in certain beings that it
  reappears under the most unfavorable conditions. It can finally end
  by assuming quite monstrous shapes.
* it is the transcendant quality of a former desire which is relived
  on contact with a relic of the past.  The memory is no longer
  poisoned, as was the desire, by the rival desire
  
Chapter 3: The metamorphosis of desire

* "Imitative desire is always a desire to be Another.  There is only
one metaphysical desire but the particular desires which instantiate
this primordial desire are of infinite variety.  From what we can
observe directly, nothing is constant in the desire of a hero of a
novel.  Even its intensity is variable.  It depends on the degree of
"metaphysical virtue" possessed by the object.  And this virtue, in
turn, depends on the distance between the object and meditor."

* Desire always increases in intensity as the mediator approaches the
  desiring subject.
* The closre the mediator comes, the more feverish the action becomes.
* As the role of the metaphysical grows greater in desire, that of the
  physical diminishes in importance.
* Stendhal: the pettier the social differences, the more affection it
  produces
* Most extreme forms of internal mediation should therefore be defined
  as a minimum difference producing a maximum affection.
* Stendhal or Proust: disappointment when possession attained is
  entirely metaphysical.  Possession of the objeect has not changed
  the subjects being.  Expected metamorphosis has not taken place.
* p90
* "decomposition of personality": comes from multiplication of
  mediators
* the briefer the reign of mediator, the more tyrannical it becomes
* the underground man's mediators succeed one another so rapidly, we
  can no longer speak of distinct selves
* man from the underground is often torn between several simultaneous
  mediations
* beginning with Proust: mediator can be anyone and popup at any
  moment
* "As the mediation becomes more unstable the yoke grows heavier.  Don
  Quixote's mediation is a feudal monarchy which is sometimes more
  symbolic than real.  But the underground man's mediation is a series
  of dictatorships as savage as they are temporary.  The results of
  this convulsive state are not limited to any particular area of
  existence; on the contrary, they are totalitarian."
  
Chapter 4: Master and slave

* Metaphysical desire is eminently contagious.
* Don Quixote spreads the "ontological sickness" to those around him
* "the truly diabolical subtlety of the ontological sickness provides
  the clue to numerous episodes."
* The supreme imitator is imitated; the work denouncing metaphysical
  desire is enlisted under its banner and becomes its best ally.
* The contagious nature of metaphysical desire is one of the most
  important points of novelistic revalation.
* Metaphysical desire is always contagious.  It becomes even more so
  as the mediator draws nearer to the hero.  
* The nearer the mediator comes the more extensive are the ravages of
  mediation.
* In the world of internal mediation, the contagion is so widespread
  that everyone can become his neighbor's mediator without ever
  understanding the role he is playing.
* Each imitates the other while claiming that his own desire is prior
  and previous.  
* The more intense the hatred the nearer it brings us to the loathed
  rival. Everything it suggests to one, it suggests equally to the
  other, including the desire to distinguish onself at all costs.
* Modern society is no longer anything but a negative imitation and
  the effort to leave the beaten path forces everyone inevitably into
  the same ditch.
* Double, or reciprocal, mediation: Renal thought he was imitating
  Valenod's desire and now VAlenod is imitating Renal's desire
* "Reality springs from the illusion and provides it with a misleading
  guarantee."
* In double mediation, the metamorphosis of the object is common to
  both partners.
* "The players are opposed but alike, and even interchangeable, for
  they make exactly the same movements." - p103
* "The players are partners, but they agree only to disagree"
* "As we know, each one holds the Other responsible for the misfortune
  which falls upon him."
* All imitated desire, no matter how noble and inoffensive it appears
  at the beginning, gradually drags its victims down into the infernal
  regions
* "In the universe of internal mediation indifference is never simply
  neutral; it is never pure absence of desire.  To the observer it
  always appears as the exteriour aspect of a desire of oneself.  And
  it is this supposed desire which is imitated.  Far from
  contradicting the laws of metaphysical desire, the dialectic of
  indifference confirms them."
* In the world of internal mediation every desire can produce other
  rival desires.
* When double mediation invades the domain of love, all hope of
  reciprocity vanishes.
* "In double mediation each one stakes his freedom against the
  other's. The struggle ends when one of the partners admits his
  desire and humbles his pride.
* "Stendhalian vanity, Proustian snobbism, and the Dostoyevskain
  underground are the new forms assumed by the struggle of
  consciousnesses in a universe of physical non-violence.
* Violence, far from serving the interests of whoever exerts it,
  reveals the intensity of his desire; thus it is a sign of slavery.  


Chapter 5: The Red and the Black

- Stendhal does not give up thinking the day he stops copying the
  thought of others; he begins to think for himself.  He must amend
  the conclusions of abstract intelligence by contact with experience.
- "Why are men not happy in the modern world? - Stendhal: we are not
  happy because we are 'vanituex'"
- "The revolutionaries thought they would be destorying vanity when
  they destroyed the privileges of the noble.  But vanity is like a
  virulent cancer that spreads in a more serious form throughout the
  body just when one thinks it has been removed.  Who is there left to
  imitate after the "tyrant"? Henceforth men shall copy each other;
  idolatry of one person is replaced by hatred of a hundred thousand
  rivals."
- Men will become gods for each other
- The vanity of the 'ancien regime' was gay, unconcerned, and
  frivoloous; the vanity of the nineteenth century is sad and
  suspicious; it has a terrible fear of ridicule.  "Envy, jealousy,
  and impotent hatred" are the accompaniment of internal mediation.
- The transistion from external to internal mediation constitutes the
  supreme phase in the decline of the nobility.
- Double mediation is a melting-pot in which differences among classes
  and individuals gradually dissolve.
- Mediated by its bourgeois audience, the nobility copies the
  bourgeoisie without even realizing it.
- "In the Ancient Regime and the Revolution, for instance, we find the
  paradox of an aristocracy that by its opposition to the middle class
  begins to resemble it, and that adopts all the virtues of which the
  middle class is trying to rid itself."
- When the aristocracy seems most alive is precisely when it is most
  dead.
- All novelistic works have a tendency to the comic
- The paradox of an aristocracy that becomes democratic through its
  very hatred of democracy is nowhere more striking than in political
  life.
- The theme throughout is reacion and reveals the negative slavery of
  internal mediation.  Party rule is the natural political expression
  of this mediation; party platforms do not bring about political
  opposition - opposition brings about party platforms.
- "moreover, we soon realize that rationalism means the death of
  privilege.  Truly noble reflection resigns itself to that death,
  just as the truly noble warrior is prepared to die on the
  battlefield."
- "First came the nobility; then followed the noble class; finally
  only a noble party is left.  After the period when the two
  coincided, spiritual and social nobility now tend to exclude each
  other; henceforth the incompatibility of privilege with greatness of
  soul is so radical that it is patent even in the attempts to conceal
  it."
- "They are ignoble because they prize nobility"
- Since the revolution no one can be privileged without knowing it.
- Historic and psychic evolution are irreversible.
- "The political elimination of the noble party cannont re-establish
  harmony and satisfy the desires that have been awakened."
- Ancient historic appearances hide a new structure of human
  relations.  The party struggle is rooted not in past inequality but
  in the present equality, no matter how imperfect it may be.
- Submission to the Other is no less absolute when it assumes negative
  forms - a puppet is no less a puppet when the strings are crossed.
- First the actors exchange threats, then they exchange roles.
- Internal mediation continues its underground work.
- The increasing equality - the approach of the mediator in our terms
  - does not give rise to harmony but to an even keener rivalry.
  Although this rivalry is the source of considerable material
  benefits, it also leads to even more considerable spiritual
  sufferings, for nothing material can appease it.
- The ontological sickness, we know, always leads its victims toward
  the "solutions" that are most likely to aggravate it.
- Stendhal, Flaubert, Tocqueville describe as "republican" or
  "democratic" an evolution which we today would call totalitarian:
   - As the mediator comes nearer and the concrete differences between
     men grow smaller, abstract opposition plays an even larger part
     in individual and collective existence.
   - Thus every human force is braced in a struggle that is as
     relentless as it is senseless, since no concrete difference or
     positive value is involved.  Totalitarianism is precisely this.
- Totalitarianism exists when all desires have been organized one by
  one into a general and permanent mobilization of being in the
  service of nothingness.
- Double mediation has invaded the growing domain of collective
  existence and wormed its way into the more intimate depths of the
  individual soul, until finally it stretches beyond national
  boundaries and annexes countries, races, and continents, in the
  heart of a universe where technical progress is wiping away one by
  one the differences between men.


Chapter 6: Technical problems in Stendhal, Cervantes, and Flaubert

- Double mediation gradually devours and digests ideas, beliefs, and
  values but it respects the outer shell: it leaves a semblance of
  life.  This secret decomposition of values drags with it the
  language in which they are supposedly reflected.
- The corruption of language is still in the first stage in the work
  of Stendhal; it is characterized by the pure and simple reversal of
  meaning
- The vaniteux never recognizes this contradiction; he talks as if a
  perfect harmony still existed between things and their names.
- By remaining faithful to out-dated categories and to a fossilized
  vocabulary Stendhal's vaniteux can fail to perceive the real
  distinctions among men and multiply those which are unreal and
  abstract.
- The passionate man is not even aware of crossing the walls of
  illusions built up by the world's vanity.
- He is the only realist in a world of lies; for this reason he always
  seems a little mad.
- The passionate person baffles and bewilders the vaniteux because he
  goes straight to the truth.  He is the involuntary negation of that
  negation which is Stendhalian vanity.
- Novelistic affirmation always springs from that negation.
- Nobility, altruism, spontaneity, and originality are mentioned
  constantly.  The passionate being appears and immediately we see
  that these words really meant slavery, copying, imitation of Others.
- The passionate person is the exception, the creature of vanity the
  rule
- The only thing that counts is the revelation of metaphysical desire.
- Although in principle the distinction between vanity and passion is
  radical, it does not allow a sharp division of people into clear-cut
  categories.  As in Cervantes, one person can embody successively
  both ontological sickness and health, depending on whether he is
  faced with a vanity less or greater than his own.
- The deeper one is immersed in vanity, the closer the mediator is to
  his subject.
- The romantic exceptoin embodies Good and the rul Evil.
- The romantic work is a weapon aimed at Others.
- The "victim" to be rescued is never more than a pretext for
  asserting oneself gloriously against the whole universe.
- A Cervantes or Stendhal manages a sublime equality of treatment of
  Self and Other which is not compromised but assured by the subtle
  dialectic of the rule and the exception.
- It is at the conclusion, and only then, that the hero speaks in the
  name of the author.  And the dying hero always renounces his past
  existence.
- IT is not merely an author's whim or his particularly peevish humor
  which is responsible for curtailing the role of spontaneous desire
  in the universe of the novel; it is rather the progress of
  ontological sickness.
- In Cervantes metaphysical desire stands out against the back-ground
  of common sense; in Stendhal spontaneous desire stands out against a
  metaphysical background.
- We must not look for the expression of a statistical truth about
  desire in a novelistic work.
- The progress of metaphysical desire merely increases the empty
  oppositions; it weakens the concrete oppositions or banishes them to
  the far boundaries of the novelistic universe.
- This advance of metaphysical desire is made on two different fronts.
  The ontological sickness grows worse in the areas already
  contaminated, and it spreads to areas thus far spared.
- Everything rests on the contrast between the rule and the exception.
- Once the reader has been given the clue to the oppositions, the
  slightest misunderstanding between two characters immediately
  suggests the pattern of passion-vanity and reveals metaphysical
  desire.
- The emptiness of the oppositions must be revealed with no outside
  help.
- The novelistic universe is a palace full of absurd ornaments and
  false windows which are there "for symmetry."
- Petty bourgeois individualism finally ends in the ridiculous
  apotheosis of the Identical and the Interchangeable.

Chapter 7: The Hero's Askesis

- Every desire that is revealed can arouse or increase a rival's
  desire; thus it is necessary to conceal desire in order to gain
  possession of the object.  Stendhal calls this concealment
  hypocrisy.
- The two partners in mediation copy one and the same desire;
  therefore this desire cannot suggest anything to one without
  suggesting it to the other as well.  The dissimulation has to be
  perfect because the mediator's perspicacity is unlimited.
- Hypocrisy for the sake of desire requires as much will power as
  religious asceticism.  It is a question of thwarting the same forces
  in both cases.
- In a universe where desire must always pass through Another, truly
  successful action is directed toward the Self.  It is totally
  interior.
- Julien Sorel owes his success to a strange strength of soul which he
  cultivates with the passion of a mystic.  This strength is dedicated
  to the service of the Self just as true mysticism is dedicated to
  the service of God.
- Every infraction of the code of hypocrisy is atoned for by an
  increase in ascetic dissimulation.
- The instinct which moves Julien, the instinct of hypocrisy, is never
  rational but it is infallible.  Julien will owe all his triumphs to
  it.
- Renunciation for the sake of desire is wholly consonant with this
  desire.  In internal mediation it is precisely the mediator-rival's
  desire which separates subject from object; but this mediator's
  desire is itself copied from the subject's desire.
- Askesis for the sake of desire discourages imitation; thus it alone can open the
  road to the object.
- The analogy between deviated transcendency and vertical transcendency is even
  closer than we at first suspect.
- The rationalist does not want to perceive the metaphysical structure of his
  desire: he contents himself with ridiculous explanations, he appeals to
  "good sense" and "psychology"
- The most profound hypocrisy can be distinguished from virtue only by its poisoned
  fruit.
- In the universe of the Red, where violence is not impossible, passion flourishes openly.
  In the universe of the Black, on the contrary, passions are concealed.
- Religious hypocrisy conceals double mediation.
- The victims of metaphysical desire always choose their political; philosophical,
  and religious ideas to fit their hatred;  thought is no more than a weapon for an
  affronted consciousness.
- Askesis for the sake of desire is an inevitable consequence of triangular desire.
- In the eyes of the novelist, modern man suffers, not because he refuses to become fully
  and totally aware of his autonomy, but because that awareness, whether real or illusory,
  is for him intolerable.  The need for transcendency seeks satisfaction in the human world
  and leads the hero into all sorts of madness.
- As the mediator comes closer, the situation changes.  Consciousness loses its control over
  the process.
- Dandyism and Stavrogin in Dostoyevsky
- The novelist's fundamental concern is not the creation of characters but the revelation
  of metaphysical desire.
- The desiring subject, when he takes possession of the object, finds that he is grasping
  a void; thus, in the final reckoning, the master ends up as far from his aim as the slave.
  By pretending and dissimulating desire, he succeeds in exerting control over the Other's
  desire.
- The slave immediately becomes a part of the kingdom of the banal of which the master
  is the center.
- The master thus pursues his sad exploration of reality indefinitely, like the positivist
  scholar who hopes to attain supreme knowledge by an exhaustive analysis of the "facts."
- The master is doomed to disillusionment and boredom.
- Only the threat, or rather the promise of a victorious resistance, attracts the master from
  now on.
- The master is not cured, he has become blase.  His cynicism is the opposite of true wisdom.
- The master seeks the object which will resist him.
- The ambitious man is not persecuted by a blind fate; it is the dialectic of pride and shame
  which is always present even at the height of glory.  The soul of the great man is constantly
  being hollowed out by the abyss of nothingness.
- Like every object of desire history is ephemeral.
- In the universe of internal mediation desire for omnipotence, like the desire for
  omniscience, contains within itself the germs of its own failure.  Desire misses its object
  at the very moment when it seems to attain it, for by becoming visible it arouses rival
  desires that stand between the hero and his object.
  - Now the master is drawn relentlessly, from desire through desire, toward the supreme
    spectacle of his own omnipotence.  He always moves, therefore, toward his own
    destruction.
- Every startling success in the universe of double mediation results from real or feigned
  indifference.
- The whole secret consists of displaying indifference without giving away one's game.
- In double mediation, as we have said, mastery is always the reward of the partner who has
  best concealed his desire.
- Only indifference can open the doors of the salon to the snob: "The lights of high society
  are so used to being sought after that one who shuns them seems to be a phoenix."
- Askesis for the sake of desire is a universal requirement in the novels of internal mediation.
- Novelistic insight is usually found in the consciousness of a master;  when this consciousness
  loses its mastery, it also loses that insight which then passes to the conqueror.
- We know that the future for mastery is slavery.
- This movement toward slavery is one of theb asic principles of novelistic structure.
- Jean Santeuil is a novel of mastery.  Remembrance of Things Past is a novel of slavery.
- when two rivals are very close to each other, double mediation ends in double fascination.
  Askesis for the sake of desire becomes involuntary and causes paralysis.
- double mediation is a figure turned in upon itself; desire circulates in it and feeds on
  its own substance.  Thus double mediation constitues a veritable "generator" of desire,
  the simples possible.
- Beginning from the standpoint of double mediation, it is easy to imagine more complex
  figures, equally autonomous, which give birth to ever more vast novelistic worlds.
- the character who plays the part of mediator in a first triable may play the part of slave
  in a second triangle and so on.
- the subject clings to a mediator who is transfigured by his desire.  He thinks he is heightening
  his individuality by desiring this being, wheras in reality he is losing it, for everyone
  is the victim of the same illusion.


Chapter 8 - Masochism and Sadism

- The master has learned from his many different experiences that an object which can be
  possessed is valueless.  So in the future he will be interested only in objects which are
  forbidden him by an implacable mediator.  The master seeks an insurmountable obstacle and he
  almost always succeeds in finding one.
- The masochist, may be originally a master who has become blase
- As we know, metaphysical desire always ends in enslavement, failure, and shame.
- enslavement leads to masochism even more directly than mastery.  The victim of internal
  mediation always sees, we may recall, a hostile intention in the mechanical obstacle which the
  desire of the mediator places in his path.  The victim is loud in his indignation but
  at heart he believes he deserves the punishment inflicted on him.  The mediator's hostility
  always seems somewhat legitimate, since by very definition the victim feels inferior to the
  person whose desire he copies.  Thus contempt and obstruction only redouble desire because they
  confirm the superiority of the mediator.  From this point it is but a short step to choosing
  the mediator, not because of his seemingly positive qualities but because of the obstruction
  he can provide; and the more a subject despises himself the more easily he makes this step.
- The masochist perceives the necessary relation between unhappiness and metaphysical desire,
  but he nevertheless does not renouce his desire.
- every passion feeds on the obstacles placed in its way and dies in their absense.
- The obstacle, even in the case of masochism where it alone is directly sought, cannot be primary.
- In the lower stages of internal mediation the subject despises himself so much that he has
  no confidence in his own judgement.
- There is only one thing whose value the masochist thinks himself capable of judging - himself,
  and his value is nil.
- We are masochists when we no longer choose our mediator because of the admiration which he
  inspires in us but because of the disgust we inspire in him.
- the great novelists, ..., in their revelation of the completely imitative existence of the
  passionate being, illuminate the darkest depths of the Western soul.
- The masochist is at once more lucid and more blind than other victims of metaphysical desire.
- The source of this ill-starred lucidity which characterizes the last stages of ontological
  sickness is not difficult to discover.  It is the increased proximity of the mediator.
  Enslavement is always the final result of desire, but at first it is very distant and the
  desiring subject cannot perceive it.
- Every metaphysical desire proceeds towards its own truth and toward the desiring subject's
  awareness of this truth; masochism occurs when the subject himself enters into the light
  of this truth and eagerly collaborates in its advent.
- Don Quixote is no more a masochist in the strict sense of the word, than Cervantes is a sadist,
  he is imitating his mediator Amadis of Gaul.
- The dividing line between sickness and health is always arbitrary and is drawn by our own
  desires.
- No one can say where a repulsive masochism begins and so-called "legitimate" ambition and a
  noble hunger for what is risky leave off.
- Every reduction of the distance between the mediator and the subject is a step in the direction
  of masochism.  The passage from external to internal mediation has itself masochistic
  implications.
- the impassioned person is seeking the divine through this insuperable obstacle, through that
  which, by definition, cannot be crossed.  It is this metaphysical meaning which has escaped
  most psychologists and psychiatrists.
- Every victim of metaphysical desire, including the masochist, covets his mediator's divinity
  and for this divinity he will accept if necessary -- and it is always necessary -- or even seek
  out, shame, humiliation, and suffering.
- To make suffering -- the simple result of desire, or, in masochism, its preliminary condition --
  the actual object of that desire is a particularly revealing "mistake."
- By restricting the deplorable consequences of metaphysical desire to an object which the
  masochist, and he alone, would desire, one makes an exceptional being of him, a monster
  whose sentiments have nothing in common with those of "normal" people, i.e., our own.
- Let us note that contradictions which in reality are the very basis of our psychic life
  always appear as "differences" between Others and ourselves.
- We dehumanize every desire whose harmful consequences we perceive in order not to recognize
  the image, or caricature, of our own desires.  Dostoyevsky accurately observes that by having
  our neighbor confined to a mental institution we convince ourselves of our own sanity.
- The sexual masochist tries to reproduce in his erotic life the conditions of an extermely
  intense metaphysical desire.
- The masochist is reduced to imitating his impossible ideal.  He wants to act with his sexual
  partner the role which he would play - or so he thinks - with his mediator.
  - the brutalities demanded by the masochist are always associated in his mind with those to which
    a truly divine model would probably subject him.
- Even in purely sexual masochism, it cannot be said that the subject "desires" suffering.  What he
  desires is his mediators presence, contact with the sacred.
- Suffering which does not remind him of the mediator is of no erotic value to the masochist.
- Sadism is the "dialectical" reverse of masochism. Tired of playing the part of the martyr,
  the desiring subject chooses to become the tormentor.
- All victims of metaphysical desire seek to appropriate their mediator's being by imitating him.
  The sadist wants to persuade himself that he has already attained his goal; he tries to take the
  place of the mediator and see the world through his eyes.
- The sadist's violence is yet another effort to attain divinity.
- One cannot be a sadist unless the key to the enchanged garden appears to be in the hands of
  a tormentor.
- Every reflection obviously comes after the thing it reflects.  Sexual masochism is a mirror for
  existential masochism and not the reverse.  Once more it must be said -- current interpretations
  always reverse the true meaning and hierarchy of the phenomena.
- The sadist never ceases to identify with the victim, that is with persecuted innocence, even
  during the very perpetration of evil.
- Deep in his heart, the masochist cannot stand the Good to which he thinks he is condemned, and
  he worships the persecuting Evil, for his mediator personifies Evil.
- Most of the time the subject is not aware of his passion for Evil.  The truth only appears in
  flashes in his sexual life and in certain remote areas of existence.
- The masochist identifies with all the "insulted and the injured," with all the real and imaginary
  misfortunes that vaguely remind him of his own destiny.  The masochist has a grudge against
  the very Spirit of Evil.  And yet he does not want to crush the wicked so much as to prove to them
  their wickedness and his own virtue; he wants to cover them with shame by making them look
  at the victims of their own infamy.
- At this state of desire the "voice of conscience" is indistinguishable from the hatred aroused
  by the mediator.
- The masochist is fundamentally a pessimist.  He knows that Evil is destined to triumph.
- All the values of Christian morality can be found in masochism but their hierarchy is inverted.
- The masochistic vision is never independent.  It is always in opposition to a rival masochism
  which is organizing the same elements into a symmetrical and inverse structure.  What is defined
  as Good on one leaf of the diptych is automatically identified as Evil on the other, and
  vice versa.
- The sado-masochist's mistake would make us laugh as much as Don Quixote's were the results of
  mediation not so terrible.
- It could be said without paradox that among heroes of novels Don Quixote is the least mad.
- The genius of the novel rises above the oppositions that stem from metaphysical desire.  It
  tries to show us their illusory character.  It transcends the rival caricatures of Good and
  Evil presented by the factions.  It affirms the identity of the opposites on the level of
  internal mediation.  But it does not end in moral relativism.  Evil exists.  Suffering is real.
- Evil exists and it is metaphysical desire itself -- deviated transcendency -- which weaves
  man's thread in the wrong direction, thus separating what it claims to unite and uniting
  what it claims to separate.  Evil is that negative pact of hatred to which so many men
  strictly adhere for their mutual destruction.

Chapter 9: The worlds of Proust

* A certain order is superimposed on reality and becomes indistinguishable from it
* The members of Combray feel a certain solidarity and brotherliness when they discover
  something which distinguishes them from the outside world.
* The novelist is trying to make us see, touch and feel what men by definition never see,
  touch, or feel: two perceptive events that are as imperative as they are contradictory
* What is the origin of this inability to communicate? [Combray and outside]
* We must go beyond the words to the substance of the novel. The truth about Swann does not
  penetrate Combray because it contradicts the family's social beliefs and its sense of
  bourgeois hierarchies.  Proust tells us that facts do not penetrate the world where our beliefs
  reign supreme.
* Eyes and ears are closed when the well-being and integrity of the personal universe are involved.
* page 197 on "these defence mechanisms"
* The Verdurin salon is not simply a meeting-place, it is a way of seeing, feeling, judging.
* How can we account for the difference between the two different types of the sacred which
  give unity, the one to the Verdurin salon, the other to Combray? [pg 200, internval vs external
  mediation]
* The disproportionate place the manifestations of this hatred hold in the existence of the salon
  provides the single but irrefutable indication of metaphysical truth: the hated outsiders
  are the true gods.
* Collective internal mediation faithfully reproduces the traits of individual mediation.  The
  happiness of being "among one's friends" is as unreal as the happiness of being oneself.
* Only the novelist looks behind the deceptive mask of the official cult and finds the hidden
  gods of internal mediation.
* Patriotism is the result of external mediation while chauvinism is rooted in internal mediation.
* The chauvinist hates a powerful, belligerent and will-disciplined Germany because he himself
  is dreaming of war, power, and discipline.
* The metaphors which continually transport us from one dimension to the other draw our attention
  to this identity of structure.
* The war which divides the universe into two enemy camps provides nourishment for the instinctive
  dualism of the masochist.
* By definition, metaphysical desire is never aimed at an accessible object.
* At the level of internal mediation, the collectivity, like the individual, ceases to be an
  absolute reference point.  The salons can now be understood only by contrasting them with
  rival salons, by fitting them into the totality of which each of them is no more than an element.
* Individualist and collectivist myths are brothers for they always mask the opposition of the
  same. The desire to be "among one's friends" just as the desire to be oneself hides a desire to
  be the Other.
* The world of the novel obtains its cohesion from these laws of internal mediation.
* The opposition between external and internal mediation is not an opposition between Good and
  Evil, it is not an absolute separation.
* The nearer the mediator comes to the desiring subject the more remote transcendency becomes
  from that vertical.  It is deviated transcendency at work.
* Like certain atomic particles, the Faubourg vanishes when scientific instruments are brought
  to bear on it.
* The Faubourg exists for the snob and does not exist for the nonsnob.
* The novelist is interested neither in the petty reality of the object nor in that same object
  transfigured by desire; he is interested in the process of transfiguration.
* The novelist who reveals triangular desire cannot be a snob but he must have been one.  He must
  have known desire but must now be beyond it.
* The Faubourg is an enchanged helmet to the snob and a barber's basin to the nonsnob.
* The novelist asks an apparently harmless question: "What is snobbism?"
* The snob seeks no concrete advantage; his pleasures and sufferings are purely metaphysical.
* Snobbism is the grain of dust that finds its way into the gears of "science" and throws it out
  of kilter.
* The snob desires nothingness.  When the concrete differences among men disappear or recede into
  the background, in any sector whatever of society, abstract rivalry makes its appearance, but
  for a long time it is confused with the earlier conflicts whose shape it assumes.
* In reading we relive the spiritual experience whose form is that of the novel itself.  
* The Marxist thinks he can do away with all alienation by destroying bourgeois society.  He
  makes no allowance for the extreme forms of metaphysical desire, those described by Proust
  and Dostoyevsky.
* We have seen how snobbism raises abstract barriers between individuals who enjoy the same
  income, who belong to the same class and to the same tradition.
* The value of the article consumed is based soley on how it is regarded by the Other.  Only
  Another's desire can produce desire.
* The Other becomes more and more fascinating the nearer he is to the Self.
* The sociologists never get as far as the laws of metaphysical desire because they do not realize
  that even material values are finally swallowed up by double mediation.  The snob desires
  nothing concrete.
* The same desire triumps in both microcosm and macrocosm. The structure is the same, only the
  pretext changes.
* The distance between pure and simple futility and cataclysmic futility is imperceptible.
* There are, in any case, no "causes" great or small, there is only the infinitely active void
  of metaphysical desire.
* We see the same indignation, the same theatrical gestures, on both sides.  The speeches are all
  the same: to make them admirable or atrocious, depending on the listener, all that is
  necessary is to reverse the proper names.
* Ideology is merely a pretext for ferocious oppositions which are secretly in agreement.
* Orwell clearly understands that the totalitarian structure is always double.
* The reader projects into the work the same mearning he already projects into the world.
* see page 227 on spreading of ontological disease and novelist
* The great novels end in the sterile abstraction of high society because the whole society
  gradually tends toward that abstraction.
* Those who portray the social elite are either very superficial or very profound depending
  on whether they reflect metaphysical desire or whether on the contrary they suceed in
  revealing it.

Chapter 10: Technical problems in Proust and Dostoyevsky

* But we shall not be so foolish as to suggest that our era has discovered
  human truths which completely eluded our forebears.
* the quid quo pro between Don Quixote and the barber reveal at the outset
  a qualitative difference of perception.
* The subjectivities who are prisoners of this metamorphic desire, that is,
  of pride, are doomed to misunderstanding.
* The novelist is able to reveal their helplessness only because he has experienced
  it himself and overcome it.  He has been victorious in his struggle with the
  imperialism of perception.
* The two victims of the quid pro quo are the tesis and the antithesis;  the novelists
  point of view is the synthesis.  (not a quid pro quo like Trump and Ukraine per se)
* The novelist is a man who has overcome desire and who, remembering it, can make
  a comparison.
* Like all novelists, Proust's narrator moves freely from room to room in the "museum
  without walls" of his existence.
* The novelist is a hero cured of metaphysical desire.
* The mediator draws nearer and desire changes shape.
* The consciousness of the characters is as deceptive as the external appearances (in Proust)
* Consequently it is no longer enough to break into the characters' consciousness.
  * characters lie to themselves -- they conceal their own desire from thier consciousness
* Stendhal and Flaubert never really needed the future or the past, since their characters
  were as yet neither divided within themselves nor split into several successive selves.
* Only an inventory of their successive about-faces makes the revelation of the truth about
  their desires possible.  And only the narrator can compile this inventory.
* The duratioon of these Selves is long enough, the transitions are gradual enough for the
  subject himself to be the first to be deceived.
* The shadow cast by the real gods can be seen behind the painted paper gods, which are
  the only ones acknowledged by the official cult.
* The wind turns the weather vane but the weather vane does not change; it would be changed
  if it stopped turning.  Proust's characters turn in the wind of their desire.  Their changes
  in direction should not be taken for genuine conversions.  They are always only the result
  of the changing data of their original mediation or, at the very most, of a change of mediator.
* Desire never actually acquires its true object: it leads to failure, oblivion, and death.
* Transcendence toward the nadir is a mirror likeness of transcendence toward the zenity.  The analogy
  between deviated transcendency and vertical transcendency never fails.
* Just as the damned and the elect in Dante are always surrouned by those who practiced the same
  vices or virtues as they themselves, so the narrator always seeks the company of the characters
  whose desire is most analogous to his own.
* In order to throw light on metaphyiscal desire at this stage of its development the novelist has
  to intervene personally; he has to become a professor proving a theorem.
* In the last volumes, however, the ontological sickness has become so serious that, as we have said before,
  the hero's existence loses all stability.
* The study of techniques, instead of creating an abyss between the great novelists, reveals the same
  ability to adapt to the very diverse demands brought about by the variations of the same desire.
* Fundamentally Dostoyevsky's method is to bring about confrontations which exhaust all possible
  relationships between the different characters in the novel.
* The complexity in Proust is on the level of the sentence, in Dostoyevsky it is on the level of the
  whole novel.
* See page 247/8/9 on the unconscious and the hidden contradictions of the mediated individual through
  the ontological sickness.
* It is never seen that the "existentialism" of the underground characters does not depend on the author
  but on the spread of the ontological sickness, on the proximity and multiplication of the mediators.
* The individual has not renounced his goal of autonomy and glorious mastery; he has not renounced
  his pride.  Instead of sharing his faith, the great novelist is trying desperately to disclose its vanity.
* The victims of metaphysical desire are caught up in a whirlwind of increasing velocity and narrowing
  circumference.
*
