Girard's model of Triangular Desire is used throughout 'Deceit, Desire
& the Novel,' (DDATN), to analyze a number of texts, revealing
characteristics of human behavior.

Operating under the context of triangular desire, the individual has
surrendered his fundamental perogative, he no longer chooses his
desires.  His desires are the desires of his mediator.

Girard does not directly appear to give his derivation of triangular
desire, but later works of his hint at it's beginnings: the 10th
commandment.

Besides the analytical power of triangular desire, it immediately
poses a more fundamental question.  If we merely copy our mediator's
desire, then but of course: who is the original?

Girard does not directly answer this, but indirectly he does.  There
aren't exactly too many ways to dance around it, and one of the
beauties of Girard's writing from my perspective, is that he answers
this *penultimate* question in a way which allows the reader to deny
God from a perhaps *scientific* perspective, while affirming his
existance from a *linguistic* perspective (the bad guy in the Bible
isn't left out of Girard's analysis either - Voldamort!).

Perhaps this is the best he can do after all, but from going through
quite a bit of Girard's work, he offers a *scientific* proof of the
existance of the *sacred* through a deductive analysis of myth,
gospel, and literature.  So my take on it is that from a *linguistic*
perspective, Girard *proves* God exists.

DDATN hints at this deductive process to come, sketching the framework
of analysis which will be used in *Violence and the Sacred.*

Oh, Girard's analysis of human life and culture, is probably the most
insightful analysis of anything I've ever read, but it is not
inherently filled with optimism.  His last work, 'Battling to the
End,' seems to conclude with the message of: welcome to the
apocolapyse.

The irony and beauty put on display by Girard in the reduction of the
complexity of life to a simple axiom is incredible.  And his method of
exposition by using literatur and texts genrally accepted to be the
best of the best is brilliant.  I'm sure my mind has been warped as
much as Don Quixote's in reading it, but I'll try to keep my madness
to myself.

The best part of Girard's work?  It proves itself.  Every trace of it
is revealed, there is no monkey business, no advanced math, and if you
follow it through, it's really really hard to brush aside.  Girard
himself shows that he didn't invent a thing.  Unlike the English
teachers you had in school, Girard actually shows how to read
something.

I mean, what is also fun, is that there is what I guess some people
would call "real science" to back up this theory.  Oh the insanity
that will come about when "real science" shows that the Bible had it
right all along.  I'll buy popcorn I guess to that show.  If you're
really bored look up mirror neurons.

It's like Forrest Gump said all along: "stupid is as stupid does."


Chapter 1:

* Once the mediators influence is felt, the sense of reality is lost
  and judgement paralyzed.
* Passion vs Vanity: what does it mean to desire? Is passion the
  opposite of vanity?  individualism?
* External vs internal mediation: the existance of the rival and
  spiritual distance to the mediator
* Double mediation: a desire begets a duplicate desire, and a rival
  * the mediator can no longer act his role of model without also
    acting or appearing to act the role of obstacle.
* Start with the rival instead of the object of desire for analysis,
  the mediator transfigures the object
* Jealousy, envy, hatred: traditional names given to internal
  mediation
* the most fervent imitation is the most denied
* vanity transforms the object
* in the birth of desire, the third person is always prsent
* psychological analysis = analysis of vanity / triangular desire
* internal mediation is a dissolving power, striking at the core of
  groups and family
* snob - p24, doesn't trust his own judgement, only others -- slave to
  fashionable
* Closer the mediator gets to subject, the mmore the possibilities of
  the two rivals merge, and the more insuperable the obstacle becomes
* highest forms of suggesstion not as different from the lowest as we
  belive, distance btw Don Quixote and advertising not as big as led
  to believe
* the aesthetic emotion is not desire, but the ending of all desire, a
  return to calm and jow
* process of mediation creates the appearance of spontaneousness and
  autonomous behavior when in fact there is none
* "recapturing the past" = destruction of one's pride
* proust asserts the equivalance of desire, hate, envy, love, jealousy
* inevitable consequence of desire copied from another desire are
  "envy, jealousy, impotent hatred"
* closer the mediator, the more bitter the fruit of triangular desire
* closer the mediator, the greater his role, and the smaller the role
  of object
  - sometimes only vestiges of an object
* deception of the hero is claiming the independence of his desire
  (internal vs external - Don Quixote cleary shows source of desire)
* "Triangular desire is one"
* hero desires only that which will frustrate his mediator
* The real "Don Juan" is not autonomous, he is incapable of doing
  without others
*
