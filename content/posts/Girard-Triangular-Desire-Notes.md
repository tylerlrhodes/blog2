Girard's model of Triangular Desire is used throughout 'Deceit, Desire
& the Novel,' (DDATN), to analyze a number of texts, revealing
characteristics of human behavior through the analysis of fictional
characters.

Using this model, Girard explores how what he calls "novels of
mediated desire" reveal the existance of metaphysical desire.  His
model of triangular desire is essentially a model which can be used
to analyze the works to confirm the revalation.

Operating under the context of triangular desire, the individual has
surrendered his fundamental perogative, he no longer chooses his
desires.  His desires are the desires of his mediator.

Girard builds his model of triangular desire from the words of Don
Quixote, and Quixote's imitation of his model of chivalry, Amadis of
Gaul.  With this foundation he couples Quixote and later works to the
model of triangular desire.

Triangular desire results in a mediation between subject and model.
While not necessarily bad, in certain forms it results in a rivalry
betwen the subject and his mediator.

Girard's analysis of texts in DDATN examines the results of this
mediation based upon essentially the distance between the mediator and
subject.  The core message driven throughout is that the closer the
mediator, the greater the chance of rivalry, and the bitterer the
result of rivalry.




Inherent in this foundation when considered outside the context of
fictional work, is a more profound question of course, however within
the context of DDATN, we are free to explore using the model of
triangular desire.

The *desire* that Girard speaks of is what he refers to as
*metaphysical desire,* and in general I think it would be a mistake to
reduce Girard's ideas to nonsense because of some reasoning along the
lines of "I just want the cookie because it tastes good, not because
the Cookie Monster suggested this desire to me."


Girard states unequivocally that novelistic works of genius have one
goal contained within: the ...

DDATN hints at this deductive process to come, sketching the framework
of analysis which will be used in *Violence and the Sacred.*

Oh, Girard's analysis of human life and culture, is probably the most
insightful analysis of anything I've ever read, but it is not
inherently filled with optimism.  His last work, 'Battling to the
End,' seems to conclude with the message of: welcome to the
apocolapyse.

The irony and beauty put on display by Girard in the reduction of the
complexity of life to a simple axiom is incredible.  And his method of
exposition by using literatur and texts genrally accepted to be the
best of the best is brilliant.  I'm sure my mind has been warped as
much as Don Quixote's in reading it, but I'll try to keep my madness
to myself.

The best part of Girard's work?  It proves itself.  Every trace of it
is revealed, there is no monkey business, no advanced math, and if you
follow it through, it's really really hard to brush aside.  Girard
himself shows that he didn't invent a thing.  Unlike the English
teachers you had in school, Girard actually shows how to read
something.

I mean, what is also fun, is that there is what I guess some people
would call "real science" to back up this theory.  Oh the insanity
that will come about when "real science" shows that the Bible had it
right all along.  I'll buy popcorn I guess to that show.  If you're
really bored look up mirror neurons.

It's like Forrest Gump said all along: "stupid is as stupid does."


Chapter 1:

* Once the mediators influence is felt, the sense of reality is lost
  and judgement paralyzed.
* Passion vs Vanity: what does it mean to desire? Is passion the
  opposite of vanity?  individualism?
* "The passionate person draws the strength of his desire from within
  himself and not from others" - passion / vanity (passion in
  Stendhal)
* A vaniteux will desire any object so long as he is convinced that it
  is already desired by another person whom he admires.  The mediator
  here is a rival, brought into existence as a rival by vanity, and
  that same vanity demands his defeat.  
* External vs internal mediation: the existance of the rival and
  spiritual distance to the mediator
* Double mediation: a desire begets a duplicate desire, and a rival
  * the mediator can no longer act his role of model without also
    acting or appearing to act the role of obstacle.
* The loathed rival is actually a mediator    
* Start with the rival instead of the object of desire for analysis,
  the mediator transfigures the object
* Jealousy, envy, hatred: traditional names given to internal
  mediation
* the most fervent imitation is the most denied
* vanity transforms the object
* in the birth of desire, the third person is always prsent
* psychological analysis = analysis of vanity / triangular desire
* internal mediation is a dissolving power, striking at the core of
  groups and family
* snob - p24, doesn't trust his own judgement, only others -- slave to
  fashionable, only desires objects desired by others
* Closer the mediator gets to subject, the mmore the possibilities of
  the two rivals merge, and the more insuperable the obstacle becomes
* highest forms of suggesstion not as different from the lowest as we
  belive, distance btw Don Quixote and advertising not as big as led
  to believe
* the aesthetic emotion is not desire, but the ending of all desire, a
  return to calm and jow
* process of mediation creates the appearance of spontaneousness and
  autonomous behavior when in fact there is none
* "recapturing the past" = destruction of one's pride
* proust asserts the equivalance of desire, hate, envy, love, jealousy
* inevitable consequence of desire copied from another desire are
  "envy, jealousy, impotent hatred"
* closer the mediator, the more bitter the fruit of triangular desire
* closer the mediator, the greater his role, and the smaller the role
  of object
  - sometimes only vestiges of an object
* deception of the hero is claiming the independence of his desire
  (internal vs external - Don Quixote cleary shows source of desire)
* "Triangular desire is one"
* hero desires only that which will frustrate his mediator
* The real "Don Juan" is not autonomous, he is incapable of doing
  without others
*

Chapter 2:

* Every hero of a novel expects his being to be radically changed by
  the act of possession.
* The object is only a means of reaching the mediator.  The desire is
  aimed at the mediators being.
* This can take the form of a desire to be initiated into a new "life"
  or "lifestyle" - p53
* The desiring subject wants to become his mediator - "perfect
  knight", "irresistible seducer"
* The curse the hero is burdened with is indistinguishable from his
  subjectivity.
* What is the source of demands the self cannot satisfy?
  * a desire originating in the self, should be satisfieable by the
  self
  * These desires (metaphysical desire) don't originate from teh self
  * false promise of metaphysical autonomy: Dostoyevsky
* "God is dead, man must take his place": "new" Western Doctrine - p56
* As the voice of pride swells, the consciousness of existence becomes
  bitter and solitary
* Everyone thinks that he alone is condemned to hell, and that is what
  makes it hell: "I am alone, and they are together."
* An individual proclaims that he does not wish to change his being
  and that he is self-sufficient: the victims of modern gospel are its
  greatest allies.  The more one becomes a slave the more one defends
  slavery.
* Choice involves choosing a model, and true freedom lies in the
  choice between a human or divine model
* pride is more external to us than the external world
* Hate is the reverse image of divine love
* The false prophets proclaim that in tomorrow's world "men will be
  gods for each other."
* The passion that drives men to seize or gain more possessions is not
  materialistic: it is the triumph of the mediator, the god with the
  human face
* Vanity prevents the addmission of failure, characters cannot equal
  the model they have chosen.
* modern historical development and the appeal of "political freedom"
  give rise or heighten vanity
* "We shall never despise the snob as much as he despises himself"
* p67 - "moral judgement", we don't have the heart to condem one who
  is "possessed"
* snobbism begins with equality
* we condomen one and forgive the other on the same moral grounds
* one must be a snob oneself to suffer from the snobbism of others
* as the distance between subject and mediator decreases, differences
  diminish, the comprehension more acute and the hatred more intense
* the lucidity and blindness both increase as the mediator comes
  nearer
* It is those who are most inclined to the "ontological sin" that
  attempt to cure Don Quixote
* It is always the most familiar forms of imitative desire which
  excite indignation
* the metaphor should reveal the significance of metaphysical desire
* The narrator always approaches his god in fear and trembling
* A childhood deprived of the sacred succeeds in ressurecting myths
  which have been dead for centuries; it revivifies the most lifeless
  symbols
* metaphysical life is so vigorours in certain beings that it
  reappears under the most unfavorable conditions. It can finally end
  by assuming quite monstrous shapes.
* it is the transcendant quality of a former desire which is relived
  on contact with a relic of the past.  The memory is no longer
  poisoned, as was the desire, by the rival desire
  
Chapter 3:

* "Imitative desire is always a desire to be Another.  There is only
one metaphysical desire but the particular desires which instantiate
this primordial desire are of infinite variety.  From what we can
observe directly, nothing is constant in the desire of a hero of a
novel.  Even its intensity is variable.  It depends on the degree of
"metaphysical virtue" possessed by the object.  And this virtue, in
turn, depends on the distance between the object and meditor."

* Desire always increases in intensity as the mediator approaches the
  desiring subject.
* The closre the mediator comes, the more feverish the action becomes.
* As the role of the metaphysical grows greater in desire, that of the
  physical diminishes in importance.
* Stendhal: the pettier the social differences, the more affection it
  produces
* Most extreme forms of internal mediation should therefore be defined
  as a minimum difference producing a maximum affection.
* Stendhal or Proust: disappointment when possession attained is
  entirely metaphysical.  Possession of the objeect has not changed
  the subjects being.  Expected metamorphosis has not taken place.
* p90
* "decomposition of personality": comes from multiplication of
  mediators
* the briefer the reign of mediator, the more tyrannical it becomes
* the underground man's mediators succeed one another so rapidly, we
  can no longer speak of distinct selves
* man from the underground is often torn between several simultaneous
  mediations
* beginning with Proust: mediator can be anyone and popup at any
  moment
* "As the mediation becomes more unstable the yoke grows heavier.  Don
  Quixote's mediation is a feudal monarchy which is sometimes more
  symbolic than real.  But the underground man's mediation is a series
  of dictatorships as savage as they are temporary.  The results of
  this convulsive state are not limited to any particular area of
  existence; on the contrary, they are totalitarian."
  
Chapter 4:

* Metaphysical desire is eminently contagious.
* Don Quixote spreads the "ontological sickness" to those around him
* "the truly diabolical subtlety of the ontological sickness provides
  the clue to numerous episodes."
* The supreme imitator is imitated; the work denouncing metaphysical
  desire is enlisted under its banner and becomes its best ally.
* The contagious nature of metaphysical desire is one of the most
  important points of novelistic revalation.
* Metaphysical desire is always contagious.  It becomes even more so
  as the mediator draws nearer to the hero.  
* The nearer the mediator comes the more extensive are the ravages of
  mediation.
* In the world of internal mediation, the contagion is so widespread
  that everyone can become his neighbor's mediator without ever
  understanding the role he is playing.
* Each imitates the other while claiming that his own desire is prior
  and previous.  
* The more intense the hatred the nearer it brings us to the loathed
  rival. Everything it suggests to one, it suggests equally to the
  other, including the desire to distinguish onself at all costs.
* Modern society is no longer anything but a negative imitation and
  the effort to leave the beaten path forces everyone inevitably into
  the same ditch.
* Double, or reciprocal, mediation: Renal thought he was imitating
  Valenod's desire and now VAlenod is imitating Renal's desire
* "Reality springs from the illusion and provides it with a misleading
  guarantee."
* In double mediation, the metamorphosis of the object is common to
  both partners.
* "The players are opposed but alike, and even interchangeable, for
  they make exactly the same movements." - p103
* "The players are partners, but they agree only to disagree"
* "As we know, each one holds the Other responsible for the misfortune
  which falls upon him."
* All imitated desire, no matter how noble and inoffensive it appears
  at the beginning, gradually drags its victims down into the infernal
  regions
* "In the universe of internal mediation indifference is never simply
  neutral; it is never pure absence of desire.  To the observer it
  always appears as the exteriour aspect of a desire of oneself.  And
  it is this supposed desire which is imitated.  Far from
  contradicting the laws of metaphysical desire, the dialectic of
  indifference confirms them."
* In the world of internal mediation every desire can produce other
  rival desires.
* When double mediation invades the domain of love, all hope of
  reciprocity vanishes.
* "In double mediation each one stakes his freedom against the
  other's. The struggle ends when one of the partners admits his
  desire and humbles his pride.
* "Stendhalian vanity, Proustian snobbism, and the Dostoyevskain
  underground are the new forms assumed by the struggle of
  consciousnesses in a universe of physical non-violence.
* Violence, far from serving the interests of whoever exerts it,
  reveals the intensity of his desire; thus it is a sign of slavery.  


Chapter 5: The Red and the Black

- Stendhal does not give up thinking the day he stops copying the
  thought of others; he begins to think for himself.  He must amend
  the conclusions of abstract intelligence by contact with experience.
- "Why are men not happy in the modern world? - Stendhal: we are not
  happy because we are 'vanituex'"
- "The revolutionaries thought they would be destorying vanity when
  they destroyed the privileges of the noble.  But vanity is like a
  virulent cancer that spreads in a more serious form throughout the
  body just when one thinks it has been removed.  Who is there left to
  imitate after the "tyrant"? Henceforth men shall copy each other;
  idolatry of one person is replaced by hatred of a hundred thousand
  rivals."
- Men will become gods for each other
- The vanity of the 'ancien regime' was gay, unconcerned, and
  frivoloous; the vanity of the nineteenth century is sad and
  suspicious; it has a terrible fear of ridicule.  "Envy, jealousy,
  and impotent hatred" are the accompaniment of internal mediation.
- The transistion from external to internal mediation constitutes the
  supreme phase in the decline of the nobility.
- Double mediation is a melting-pot in which differences among classes
  and individuals gradually dissolve.
- Mediated by its bourgeois audience, the nobility copies the
  bourgeoisie without even realizing it.
- "In the Ancient Regime and the Revolution, for instance, we find the
  paradox of an aristocracy that by its opposition to the middle class
  begins to resemble it, and that adopts all the virtues of which the
  middle class is trying to rid itself."
- When the aristocracy seems most alive is precisely when it is most
  dead.
- All novelistic works have a tendency to the comic
- The paradox of an aristocracy that becomes democratic through its
  very hatred of democracy is nowhere more striking than in political
  life.
- The theme throughout is reacion and reveals the negative slavery of
  internal mediation.  Party rule is the natural political expression
  of this mediation; party platforms do not bring about political
  opposition - opposition brings about party platforms.
- "moreover, we soon realize that rationalism means the death of
  privilege.  Truly noble reflection resigns itself to that death,
  just as the truly noble warrior is prepared to die on the
  battlefield."
- "First came the nobility; then followed the noble class; finally
  only a noble party is left.  After the period when the two
  coincided, spiritual and social nobility now tend to exclude each
  other; henceforth the incompatibility of privilege with greatness of
  soul is so radical that it is patent even in the attempts to conceal
  it."
- "They are ignoble because they prize nobility"
- Since the revolution no one can be privileged without knowing it.
- Historic and psychic evolution are irreversible.
- "The political elimination of the noble party cannont re-establish
  harmony and satisfy the desires that have been awakened."
- Ancient historic appearances hide a new structure of human
  relations.  The party struggle is rooted not in past inequality but
  in the present equality, no matter how imperfect it may be.
- Submission to the Other is no less absolute when it assumes negative
  forms - a puppet is no less a puppet when the strings are crossed.
- First the actors exchange threats, then they exchange roles.
- Internal mediation continues its underground work.
- The increasing equality - the approach of the mediator in our terms
  - does not give rise to harmony but to an even keener rivalry.
  Although this rivalry is the source of considerable material
  benefits, it also leads to even more considerable spiritual
  sufferings, for nothing material can appease it.
- The ontological sickness, we know, always leads its victims toward
  the "solutions" that are most likely to aggravate it.
- Stendhal, Flaubert, Tocqueville describe as "republican" or
  "democratic" an evolution which we today would call totalitarian:
   - As the mediator comes nearer and the concrete differences between
     men grow smaller, abstract opposition plays an even larger part
     in individual and collective existence.
   - Thus every human force is braced in a struggle that is as
     relentless as it is senseless, since no concrete difference or
     positive value is involved.  Totalitarianism is precisely this.
- Totalitarianism exists when all desires have been organized one by
  one into a general and permanent mobilization of being in the
  service of nothingness.
- Double mediation has invaded the growing domain of collective
  existence and wormed its way into the more intimate depths of the
  individual soul, until finally it stretches beyond national
  boundaries and annexes countries, races, and continents, in the
  heart of a universe where technical progress is wiping away one by
  one the differences between men.


Chapter 6: Technical problems in Stendhal, Cervantes, and Flaubert

- Double mediation gradually devours and digests ideas, beliefs, and
  values but it respects the outer shell: it leaves a semblance of
  life.  This secret decomposition of values drags with it the
  language in which they are supposedly reflected.
- The corruption of language is still in the first stage in the work
  of Stendhal; it is characterized by the pure and simple reversal of
  meaning
- The vaniteux never recognizes this contradiction; he talks as if a
  perfect harmony still existed between things and their names.
- By remaining faithful to out-dated categories and to a fossilized
  vocabulary Stendhal's vaniteux can fail to perceive the real
  distinctions among men and multiply those which are unreal and
  abstract.
- The passionate man is not even aware of crossing the walls of
  illusions built up by the world's vanity.
- He is the only realist in a world of lies; for this reason he always
  seems a little mad.
- The passionate person baffles and bewilders the vaniteux because he
  goes straight to the truth.  He is the involuntary negation of that
  negation which is Stendhalian vanity.
- Novelistic affirmation always springs from that negation.
- Nobility, altruism, spontaneity, and originality are mentioned
  constantly.  The passionate being appears and immediately we see
  that these words really meant slavery, copying, imitation of Others.
- The passionate person is the exception, the creature of vanity the
  rule
- The only thing that counts is the revelation of metaphysical desire.
- Although in principle the distinction between vanity and passion is
  radical, it does not allow a sharp division of people into clear-cut
  categories.  As in Cervantes, one person can embody successively
  both ontological sickness and health, depending on whether he is
  faced with a vanity less or greater than his own.
- The deeper one is immersed in vanity, the closer the mediator is to
  his subject.
- The romantic exceptoin embodies Good and the rul Evil.
- The romantic work is a weapon aimed at Others.
- The "victim" to be rescued is never more than a pretext for
  asserting oneself gloriously against the whole universe.
- A Cervantes or Stendhal manages a sublime equality of treatment of
  Self and Other which is not compromised but assured by the subtle
  dialectic of the rule and the exception.
- It is at the conclusion, and only then, that the hero speaks in the
  name of the author.  And the dying hero always renounces his past
  existence.
-
