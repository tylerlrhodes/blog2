Girard's model of Triangular Desire is used throughout 'Deceit, Desire
& the Novel,' (DDATN), to analyze a number of texts, revealing
characteristics of human behavior.

Operating under the context of triangular desire, the individual has
surrendered his fundamental perogative, he no longer chooses his
desires.  His desires are the desires of his mediator.

Girard does not directly appear to give his derivation of triangular
desire, but later works of his hint at it's beginnings: the 10th
commandment.

Besides the analytical power of triangular desire, it immediately
poses a more fundamental question.  If we merely copy or mediator's
desire, then but of course: who is the original?

Girard does not directly answer this, but indirectly he does.  There
aren't exactly too many ways to dance around it, and one of the
beauties of Girard's writing from my perspective, is that he answers
this *penultimate* question in a way which allows the reader to deny
God from a perhaps *scientific* perspective, while affirming his
existance from a *linguistic* perspective.

Perhaps this is the best he can do after all, but from going through
quite a bit of Girard's work, he offers a *scientific* proof of the
existance of the *sacred* through a deductive analysis of myth,
gospel, and literature.  So my take on it is that from a *linguistic*
perspective, Girard *proves* God exists.

DDATN hints at this deductive process to come, sketching the framework
of analysis which will be used in *Violence and the Sacred.*

Oh, Girard's analysis of human life and culture, is probably the most
insightful analysis of anything I've ever read, but it is not
inherently filled with optimism.  His last work, 'Battling to the
End,' seems to conclude with the message of: welcome to the
apocolapyse.

The irony, the complexity of modern life, reduced to the simplest
foundantions, and rebuilt from there through an analysis of
literature.  Girard's work is that of a scientist, and his petry dish
is the texts of humanity.

The best part of Girard's work?  It proves itself.  Every trace of it
is revealed, there is no monkey business, no advanced math, and if you
follow it through, it's really really hard to brush aside.  Girard
himself shows that he didn't invent a thing.  Unlike the English
teachers you had in school, Girard actually shows how to read
something.

Chapter 1:

* Once the mediators influence is felt, the sense of reality is lost
  and judgement paralyzed.
* Passion vs Vanity: what does it mean to desire? Is passion the
  opposite of vanity?  individualism?
* External vs internal mediation: the existance of the rival and
  spiritual distance to the mediator
* Double mediation: a desire begets a duplicate desire, and a rival
  * the mediator can no longer act his role of model without also
    acting or appearing to act the role of obstacle.
* Start with the rival instead of the object of desire for analysis,
  the mediator transfigures the object
* Jealousy, envy, hatred: traditional names given to internal
  mediation
* the most fervent imitation is the most denied
* vanity transforms the object
* in the birth of desire, the third person is always prsent
* psychological analysis = analysis of vanity / triangular desire
* internal mediation is a dissolving power, striking at the core of
  groups and family
*
