I think I liked *The Stranger*.  I mean it's kind of interesting, and
it made me think at the end, but if you ask me why it's called 'The
Stranger' I won't have a good answer.

Is society supposed to be the stranger?  At least until the end of the
book?

It's short, and it's a fast read, and it's definitely written well.
It's barely over 100 pages, and since Camus is a Nobel Prize winner I
guess by default that means it's better than good.  Supposedly it's a
fictional account of *absurdism*. Having read *The Myth of
Sisyphus*, also by Camus, I can see how this makes sense.

Pushed I would say that I did like the book on it's own, regardless of
it being a fictional account of absurdism and demonstrating some
philosophy. 

Would I recommend this book to a friend?  I think so.  It's short
enough to read in a day or two, and despite my mixed feelings towards
the book, it is regarded as a fine work of literature.

There were spots in the book where I laughed, and a few other spots
where I just read along, watching the main character, Meursault, live
through the events of the book.  From the beginning it felt to me like
Meursault never had a chance.  Of course it's debatable whether or
not he deserves his fate, but it is somewhat fun watching it be meted
out in the end.

The book ultimately calls for reflection, but thinking about it beyond
whether it was simply good or not would be something out of place for
a simple book review.

Overall it was good and I don't regret reading it.  It's short and if
you read it you'll know who Salamano is and why occasionally people
talk about his dog.
