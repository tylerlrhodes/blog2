description: An overview of AWS Lambda with examples in Clojure.

Lambda, Lambda, Lambda.

AWS Lambda Lambda Lambda, anyway.

The technology that was going to make everybody's life easier because
you would be able to just deploy "code." Just throw it up there into
the cloud and let AWS run it for you.  Who needs servers anymore?
Just run the code and be done with it!  Anybody can do it.

Welp, AWS Lambda has been around for a while now.  It has good parts
and bad parts.  People use it.  Software runs on it.  It works.  In
the future there are no servers.  Only code.  And the future is now.
Except there really are servers anyway.

### So What is AWS Lambda? ###

AWS Lambda is "serverless" something or other.  It lets you write some
code and just upload it to AWS where they manage running it for you,
as long as you configure it and tell them what to run.

It is entirely managed by AWS for you basically.  Scalability,
reliability, other important things.  Security updates? Who needs to
patch a server anymore when you can just run it on Lambda?

Fine grained billing -- you pay for how long your code runs and how
much memory you use.  It runs a lot?  You pay a lot.  It doesn't run a
lot?  You don't pay a lot.

Ultimately AWS Lambda is a way for you to run code you wrote in the
cloud without having to manage the underlying hardware and software.
You only need to write the code and upload it, and the rest is done
for you.






It's not AWS Lambda's fault that all Lambdas are written and deployed
five minutes before happy hour on a Friday!
