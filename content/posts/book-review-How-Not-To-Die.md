*How Not To Die* by Dr. Michael Greger is quite simply a book which
 advocates for eating a "whole-food plant based diet."  It's a fairly
 quick read, and although I haven't gone through the "recipe" portion
 of the book, the first half was informative.  It catalogs the top 15
 causes of death in the US, and through an analysis of medical studies
 shows how diet plays a giant part in both causing and preventing
 disease.

The book and Dr. Greger are not without controversy, at least on the
internet.  Without being abreast of the latest research and studies
and having the skills and time to interpret them, the majority of us
leave the analysis to the "experts" and synthesize that information.
Any topic which touches on something which affects folks lives is
going to be controversial with people having deep set beliefs and
opinions.  Diet is a huge part of peoples lives, and food, beyond just
providing sustenance is steeped in tradition and culture.  So when
Dr. Greger advocates for essentialy a healthy vegan diet it's natural
for people to disagree.

Without going into what other random people on the internet say, I'll
just say that I found the book to be informative and useful, and if
anything, made me want to be healthier.  The studies he cites, and the
analysis he provides, is certainly convincing.  Throughout the book,
which provides statistics pertaining to reducing the likelihood of
common disease, Greger advocates for a whole food plant based diet,
or, essentially a healthy vegan diet.  Emphasis being on healthy vegan
diet, since you can live on french fries and soda and still be a
vegan.

The book is thought provoking and besides its insight on diet and
disease also touches on topics related to government and medicine.
For instance, Greger claims that medical schools barely teach
nutrition at all.  He indicts the industry for being structured around
performing procedures and billing to make money, which isn't hard to
believe.  His treatment of the "recommended" dietary guidelines
provided by the US government is pretty comical given what they
recommend and what his research shows.  He also discusses the
influence of industry on governmental and medical guidelines.

Overall, despite his criticism of both the medical and food industry,
the book offers reason to be hopeful.  If anything it drives home the
point that you are what you eat and offers a "statistical" approach to
being healthy and reducing your risks for chronic illness later in
life.

I'd definitely recommend reading the book if you're interested in
medicine and health.  Don't worry about it turning you into a vegan
and a health nut.  I'll die before I stop eating pizza with real cheese.
