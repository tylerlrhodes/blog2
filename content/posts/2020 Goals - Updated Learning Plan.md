It's generally kind of hard to do these reviews and plans and have
them actually match up with what happens.  Most of the time I just
haphazardly start reading and doing things, then, I go back and look
at the plan and, well, whatever.

But I kind of like to do them anyway.  Despite the fact that I
usually don't exactly follow the plan, and do lots of stuff that
wasn't on the plan, and think of new things I want on the plan, and so
on and so on, it is still kind of useful.  Or maybe it's just that
planning makes me feel like I'm doing something, and I kind of am?

When I started blogging, I started kind of doing these plans, and
thinking of stuff I could learn and blog about.  The goal for this
blog originally was just for it to be "good".  Whatever that means.
Good, technical, and to use it as a means of improving my writing
ability.  It's kind of working out like that, which is good.

Back in April, I laid out a 2019 goals kind of thing and posted it,
and I feel pretty good about it still.  I definitely didn't do
everything I listed, I did better in the non-technical part than the
technical part.  I got sidetracked with the technical part a little.

Then, later in the year, in August, I wrote a really long and boring
post about distraction and tsundoku and focusing.  So the focusing and
distraction is still the main issue.  But I haven't bought a new book
since I wrote that, and I've read 10 books since then.  They weren't
technical books, but they were "serious" books.

And now I have a list of 50 new books that I came across, either
referred to by the books I was reading, or that I found online
somehow.  The surprising part, for me, is that out of the 50, only 7
are technical.

So I made kind of a deal with myself that I would only but 20 books
this year.  I probably won't even read many of them, but I kind of
like to buy books.  And I like to plan on reading them.  And I do like
to read them too.

But I also like to finish things on occassion that I had planned to
finish.  Looking back, for example, I started SICP almost a year and a
half ago, and I'm still not done!  I haven't even really worked on it
since November of 2018 it looks like.  So it's definitely time to
finish SICP.

This year I'll break up my learning plan and goals into three
sections: Books to Read, Posts to Write, and Things to Do.

Book)
