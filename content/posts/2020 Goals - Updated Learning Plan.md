It's hard to write out a plan and then come back to it months or a
year later and think what the hell was I smoking.  But, for the future
when I look back at this, I wasn't smoking anything.  Just naturally
delusional.

This years goals reflect that I'm terrible at sticking with the books
I think I'm going to read.  So I'm only listing 4 books.  Then I would
like to actually write some blog entries, and remember things about
the things I read and worked on last year, so I listed out a lot of
posts I would like to write.

### Books to Read

Book)

There's a few goals I dragged over from the 2019 list, because I still
want to do them.  Overall the technical stuff is still working on the
base to be able to better understand programming languages and
compilers, realizing that it will take some time with other things
going on.

I also have a parallel track not related to the technical which
leaked through into some of the blog posts I'd like to write.  I'm not
sure where this track is going, but there are going to be some books
fighting with the ones on the list here.  So we'll see what happens in
2020.
