description: "Review of Deceit, Desire, and the Novel.  Rene Girard's
analysis and exposition of novels of mediated desire"
---

Back in August I stumbled across a summary of Rene Girard's mimetic
theory online (via a link on Hacker News) and immediately became
interested in it.

Since then I've read a number of books by Girard, the first of which
was *I See Satan Fall Like Lightening.* This book had an impact on me,
not so much due to the fact that it has anything to do with
Christianity (which it does), but because it offers a new framework
for understanding violence.

I was so taken by the theory that I now own a number of Girard's
books, and have read many of them now.  His all encompassing
mimetic theory is developed throughout all of his work in a rich and
fascinating manner. In each work he explores life and
the culture using his theory, showing how it functions.

His first book, *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel (DDATN)*, which is the
subject of this review, takes a look some key novels, and again
performs an analysis drawing on mimetic theory.  Girard reviews works
by a number of the masters of literature: Cervantes, Stendhal,
Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky.  Through the lens of mimetic theory,
here termed *triangular desire*, Girard offers up an analysis of these
books which is deeply thought provoking and relevant.

*Triangular desire*, described in the book as a model of sorts, or, as
Girard puts it: "a systematic metaphor, systematically pursued,"
offers a simple and powerful tool for analysis.

The triangle of *triangular desire* is made up of the mediator (or
model), the subject, and the object.  Girard hypothesizes that humans
learn their desires through the imitation of their model.  In effect,
our desires come from another -- a mediator or model.  Thus in the
triangle of *triangular desire*, the subject's desires are mediated
via the model, and the object of the subject's desire is in effect
learned through the model.

DDATN explores a number of ideas and themes with regards to
*triangular desire* which are present in varying forms through the
novels analyzed, including: vanity, metaphysical desire, politics, and
interpersonal relationships.  Girard's explanations and analysis of
the texts offers a lot of ground for review and study, and despite
being published in 1961 is certainly still relevant.  Reading his
explanations and reasoning about the texts in question begs for
further thought on any number of topics.

Girard is obviously a master at interpreting just about everything
through mimetic theory, or in this book *triangular desire*.  One of
the criticisms of mimetic theory is that it is in effect a theory of
everything.  Girard wields it the same way a physicist might discuss
the impact of gravity on all things.

The difference of course is that we can prove in a material sense the
effects and reality of gravity.  Gravity isn't open to interpretation,
the nature of desire, and with it, the essence of individuality and
free will, kind of are.

However, in an effort to keep this book review about the book at hand,
I'll simply gloss over the small issue of whether or not *triangular
desire*, or mimetic theory, is actually correct.  I will say however
that reading Rene Girard's analysis of literature and culture, and in
later works, religion, myth, and psychology, is super fun and
interesting.

Besides, if mimetic theory is actually the humanities equivalent of
gravity, eventually we'll have quantum mimetic theory, and then just
fuck it.

DDATN is a giant treasure chest of thought and analysis, and reading
Girard's interpretation of these author's works shows just how
powerful a model *triangular desire* (mimetic theory) can be.  If
anything it is a tool which is a never ending source of interpretive
power, one which can be wielded far and wide across any number of
subjects.

Girard's *triangular desire*, here used perhaps more humbly than it is
in his later works (he explains a lot, but it's not this book where he
deduces the founding mechanism of religion with it), is so strikingly
simple and used in such an interesting way by Girard, that something
about it makes me want to study it and see how it may apply to other
subjects.

Of Girard's works that I've read DDATN is the one that offers the
most so far on non-religious aspects of his theory, touching more on
character development and the potential psychological aspects of
mimetic theory, in addition to cultural topics which are still
relevant today.  There are other works of his which also cover
literary works outside of religion, but I haven't read them.

That said, it's not the first book by Girard that I read, and if I
wasn't as moved by the theory as I was by reading *I See Satan Fall
Like Lightening*, I'm not sure DDATN would have grabbed me in the same
way.  It's probably not the way to start if you're interested in
mimetic theory and just looking to begin somewhere.  If you're more
interested in it for its analysis of the texts covered and less so for
how it relates to mimetic theory it would be great.

In reading DDATN Girard will make you want to read the novels and
authors he talks about (speaking as a newly proud owner of Don
Quixote).  It seems like most people agree that the works he looks at
are some of the best, and are probably worth reading anyway.

If you are interested in mimetic theory and want to see it
used in analysis of issues that are relevant in contemporary times,
*Deceit, Desire, and the Novel* is a great book.
