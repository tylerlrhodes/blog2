Back in August I stumbled across a summary of Rene Girard's mimetic
theory online (via a link on Hacker News) and immediately became
interested in it.

Since then I've read a number of books by Girard, the first of which
was *I See Satan Fall Like Lightening.* This book had an impact on me,
not so much due to the fact that it has anything to do with
Christianity (which it does), but because it offers a new framework
for understanding violence.

But this review is about *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel,* another book
by Girard, which takes a look some key novels, and again performs an
analysis drawing on mimetic theory.  Girard reviews works by a number
of the masters of literature: Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust
and Dostoevsky.  Through the lens of mimetic theory, here termed
*triangular desire*, Girard offers up an analysis of these books which
is deeply thought provoking and relevant.

* expand and make this paragraph below mean something

While the analysis can at times appear complex, at it's core it's
driven once again by mimetic theory, which at its core, is fairly
simple.  Girard explains the process here using the term *triangular
desire*, which is basically mimetic theory.

* and lead into this paragraph

The triangle of *triangular desire* is made up of the mediator (or
model), the subject, and the object.  Girard hypothosizes that humans
learn their desires through the imitation of their model.  In effect,
our desires come from another -- a mediator or model.  Thus in the
triangle of *triangular desire*, the subject's desires are mediated
via the model, and the object of the subject's desire is in effect
learned through the model.

* integrate the following paragrahs better

Girard is obviously a master at interpreting just about everything
through mimetic theory, or in this book *triangular desire*.  One of
the criticisms of mimetic theory is that it is in effect a theory of
everything.  Girard wields it the same way a physicist might discuss
the impact of gravity on all things.

The difference of course is that we can prove in a material sense the
effects and reality of gravity.  Gravity isn't open to interpretation,
human relations, are.  Girard's interpretations and analysis is
somewhat akin to looking at the same set of texts we've always looked
at, but now, we know about gravity.


Mimetic theory, however, despite its subjective nature, provides a
coherent framework for interpreting relationships between people, and
societies, in a manner which is compelling, and strikes me as being
the most promising way for interpreting events, literature, and life,
within a framework 


he
triangle here, as Girard states, is not essentially real, rather it is
a systematic metaphor, one which can be bent and shaped continuously
to the works under analysis.  Girard uses it as a model, or family of
models, which allude to, as he says, the mystery, transparent yet
opaque, of human relations.
