Back in August I stumbled across a summary of Rene Girard's mimetic
theory online (via a link on Hacker News) and immediately became
interested in it.

Since then I've read a number of books by Girard, the first of which
was *I See Satan Fall Like Lightening.* This book had an impact on me,
not so much due to the fact that it has anything to do with
Christianity (which it does), but because it offers a new framework
for understanding violence.

But this review is about *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel (DDATN)*,
another book by Girard, which takes a look some key novels, and again
performs an analysis drawing on mimetic theory.  Girard reviews works
by a number of the masters of literature: Cervantes, Stendhal,
Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky.  Through the lens of mimetic theory,
here termed *triangular desire*, Girard offers up an analysis of these
books which is deeply thought provoking and relevant.

*Triangular desire*, described in the book as a model of sorts, or, as
Girard puts it: "a systematic metaphor, systematically pursued,"
offers a simple and powerful tool for analysis.

The triangle of *triangular desire* is made up of the mediator (or
model), the subject, and the object.  Girard hypothosizes that humans
learn their desires through the imitation of their model.  In effect,
our desires come from another -- a mediator or model.  Thus in the
triangle of *triangular desire*, the subject's desires are mediated
via the model, and the object of the subject's desire is in effect
learned through the model.

DDATN explores a number of ideas and themes with regards to
*triangular desire* which are present in varying forms through the
novels analysed, including: vanity, metaphysical desire, politics, and
interpersonal relationships.  Girard's explanations and analysis of
the texts offers a lot of ground for review and study, and despite
being published in 1961 is certainly still relevant.  Reading his
explanations and reasonings about the texts in question begs for
further thought on any number of topics.

Girard is obviously a master at interpreting just about everything
through mimetic theory, or in this book *triangular desire*.  One of
the criticisms of mimetic theory is that it is in effect a theory of
everything.  Girard wields it the same way a physicist might discuss
the impact of gravity on all things.

The difference of course is that we can prove in a material sense the
effects and reality of gravity.  Gravity isn't open to interpretation,
the nature of desire, and with it, the essense of individuality and
free will, kind of are.

However, in an effort to keep this book review about the book at hand,
I'll simply gloss over the small issue of whether or not *triangular
desire*, or mimetic theory, is actually correct.  I will say however
that reading Rene Girard's analysis of literature and culture, and in
later works, religion, myth, and psychology, is super fun and
interesting.

Besides, if mimetic theory is actually the humanities equivalant of
gravity, eventually we'll have quantum mimetic theory, and then just
fuck it.

Keeping to this book and not falling into defending or attacking
mimetic theory, I'll say that maybe you should read it.

Maybe you should read it if you've ever been left wanting with regards
to the question of why we want what we want, and do what we do.  Does
it offer a mathematical proof to validate its veracity and
correctness?  No.  Does it however begin to offer a framework and
model which just maybe explains the course of events of life,
individually and collectively, in a way that actually seems to make
sense?  This is what it promises to do.  Whether it does or not is of
course up to the reader.

DDATN is a giant treasure chest of thought and analysis, and reading
Girard's interpretation of these author's works shows just how
powerful a model *triangular desire* (mimetic theory) can be.  If
anything it is a tool which is a never ending source of interpretive
power, one which can be wielded far and wide across any number of
subjects.

By reading DDATN Girard will make you want to read the novels and
authors he talks about (speaking as a newly proud owner of Don
Quixote).  It seems like most people agree that the works he looks at
are some of the best, and are probably worth reading anyway.

Is *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel* worth reading? Undoubtedly.
