Back in August I stumbled across a summary of Rene Girard's mimetic
theory online (via a link on Hacker News) and immediately became
interested in it.

Since then I've read a number of books by Girard, the first of which
was *I See Satan Fall Like Lightening.* This book had an impact on me,
not so much due to the fact that it has anything to do with
Christianity (which it does), but because it offers a new framework
for understanding violence.

But this review is about *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel,* another book
by Girard, which takes a look some key novels, and again performs an
analysis drawing on mimetic theory.  In it he looks at novels he
classifies as novels of mediated desire.  Girard classifies these as
novels of the highest form essentially, and the books he includes in
his analysis are generally widely regarded as such.

* find where in book girard says novels of mediated desire

While the analysis can at times appear complex, at it's core it's
driven once again by mimetic theory, which at its core, is fairly
simple.  Girard explains the process here using the term *triangular
desire*, which is basically mimetic theory.

The triangle of *triangular desire* is made up of the mediator (or
model), the subject, and the object.  Girard hypothosizes that humans
learn their desires through the imitation of their model.  In effect,
our desires come from another -- a mediator or model.  Thus in the
triangle of *triangular desire*, the subject's desires are mediated
via the model, and the object of the subject's desire is in effect
learned through the model.

* reword and rewrite this paragraph

Girard is obviously a master at interpreting just about everything
through mimetic theory, and in this book *triangular desire*.  The
triangle here, as Girard states, is not essentially real, rather it is
a systematic metaphor, one which can be bent and shaped continuously
to the works under analysis.  Girard uses it as a model, or family of
models, which allude to, as he says, the mystery, transparent yet
opaque, of human relations.

* vanity and snobbism
