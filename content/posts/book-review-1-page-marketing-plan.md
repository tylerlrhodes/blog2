Allan Dib's book, 'The 1-Page Marketing Plan,' is a book for
entrepreneurs to up their marketing game with a simple strategic and
tactical vision for making more money through marketing.

Dib's one sentence summary of the book given in the introduction is,
"the fastest path to money."  And he does lay it out in slightly north
of 200 pages in this paperback which outlines the why and how of
marketing for an entrepreneur.  Or at least according to him this is
the fastest path.  I'm assuming bank robbery is not an acceptable
method to compare here.  I'll go ahead and rule out counterfeit money
too.  Hey, that's a bunch of Monopoly money!

In all seriousness despite not having a small business, I do have
aspirations of writing a few E-Books and making an extra dollar on this
blog one day, so I am kind of in the target market here.  I'm not even
sure why I bought this book, but I'll blame it on some successful
marketing that Mr. Dib is most likely responsible for.

It's always nice to know that generally speaking, even if you have an
excellent product, you still need marketing to let people know about
it!  I hate this fact, but it seems like there is no way around it.
Mr. Dibs drives this little message home throughout the book.

The 1-Page plan this book comes up with literally is 1-Page, and it
does seem smart to me.  It's not just about acquiring leads and making
a sale, it also goes into the lifetime value of a customer, building a
"tribe" of raving fans, and how to orchestrate referrals.

All in all for 200 pages, and a book I probably only spent 15 dollars
on, I'd say it was a purchase very well made.

I can't speak to it's results, and personally I know for a fact that
I'm not the best marketer around.  But with this book and the 1-Page
plan I have something to work with at the same time as I work on my
writing skills to put together an E-Book one day.

The 1-Page plan is a set of nine boxes to fill in on a single page.
It's a page with three rows split into three columns.

The first row is for the "Before (Prospect)" stage of the marketing
plan.  The three columns are:

* My Target Market
* My Message to My Target Market
* The Media I Will Use to Reach My Target Market

The second row is for the "During (Lead)" phase and includes:

* My Lead Capture System
* My Lead Nurturing System
* My Sales Conversion Strategy

The third row is for the "After (Customer)" phase and includes:

* How I Deliver a World-Class Experience
* How I Increase Customer Lifetime Value
* How I Orchestrate and Stimulate Referrals

Overall I felt like the book gave a great guide to the overall
marketing plan and strategy that I should build to sell an E-Book and
get a few more readers for my blog; both in that I need to have a
target market clearly defined, and also deliver value in a way that
makes sense.

One thing I appreciated about this book was that it wasn't just about
quick marketing or cheap sales gimmicks.  It was about building a
quality marketing plan for a potentially very small or medium sized
business, and one of the messages was delivering value to customers
more than just selling them something quickly.

The book codifies a lot of marketing tactics and how to incorporate
them into a strategy to market a business or product.  The author
obviously goes over many of his preferences, and for the most part I
agree with him on just about all of it at first glance.  For instance,
he prefers building an email list and website or blog for his product
instead of solely relying on social media.  I agree 100%.

I'd recommend this book if you're looking for a fairly quick read on
marketing and some strategy and tactics to implement.
