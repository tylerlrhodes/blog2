Chapter 2: Conjunctions

* main clause: central point of the sentence
* subordinating conjunction: lowers a clause to a lower grammatical status in the sentence
* conjunctions: are for "hooking up words and phrases and clauses"
  ex: and, if, but, so, because ...
* coordinating conjunctions: link units of equal grammatical status: and, or, but
  FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so
* subordinating conjunctions: much larger set of words
  after, although, as, because, before, if, since, than, though, unless, until, while, when ...
  also phrases: as long as, as though, even if, even though, in order that, whether or not ...
* It is possible to make a complete sentece incomplete by adding a subordinating conjunction
* Subordinating conjunction creates a subordinate clause, or dependent clause


Chapter 3: Movable Objects - understanding phrases and clauses
* a clause is a unit that usually contains a subject and verb
* a phrase is a unit of one or more words that works as either a noun, verb, an adverb,
  an adjective, or something called a prepositional phrase.
* a phrase is a single word or a cluster of words that together work in your sentence as a
  single part of speech.
* phrases can have phrases within them
* every phrase has a headword: "Jesse of Sunnybrook Farm", Jesse is the headword, and because it's
  a noun, this is a noun phrase
* prepositional phrase: takes an object, usually a noun phrase: "with a happily married septaugenarian woman."
  - starts with words like: with, of, to, at, in, above, before ...
* Transitive verbs and prepositions are the only parts of speech that take objects
  - I see Betty
  - I dance with Betty
* "Jesse has danced the tango with a happily married septuagenarian woman who was wearing Spanx."
  - happily - adverb phrase
  - happily married - adjective phrase
  - septuagenarian - adjective phrase
  - a happily married septuagenarian woman - noun phrase
  - who was wearing Spanx - relative cluase (modifier which means it works like an adjective)
* commands, called imperatives, drop the subject:
  - Stop! = [you] stop!
