Mimetic theory is the work of a French-American named Rene Girard, and
is nothing short of a theory of it all.  It's basically gravity.
Invisible, pervasive, and with no escape from it, it operates and
drives human behavior and culture.

But is it actually right?  Does it explain history and the modern
world as Rene Girard claims?

Is it simply a modern explantion of the essential truths of human life
and culture as has been revealed all along by literature and the
Bible, as Girard basically says?

Regardless, it's definitely interesting, powerful, and I believe
relevant.

In what follows I'm going to do my best to do justice to mimetic
theory by summarizing its key ideas and hopefully not butchering it
beyond recognition.
