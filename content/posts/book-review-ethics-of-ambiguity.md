*The Ethics of Ambiguity* is a book by Simone de Beauvoir delving into
the development of an ethics within the framework of existentialism.
In the book de Beauvoir explores the basics of existentialism
including the fundamental ambiguity of existence as an individual, and
how building upon the principle of freedom, an ethics can be
developed.

The first chapter takes on the task of outlining and defining the
ambiguity and freedom which provide the basis for understanding the
rest of the book.  Since I'm not very familiar with existentialism or
the language used to describe its ideas, my ability to understand some
of the concepts of "being" were stretched.  Reading through the book,
the idea that "man makes himself a lack of being in order that there
may be being," is something that I have to return to and think on
through different sections of the book.  

In the first chapter de Beauvoir lays out the reasons that
existentialism provides a good grounding for developing an ethics, and
she provides the basis for developing an ethics of which freedom is
the primary driver.  Combined with the fundamental ambiguity of man's
existence as a being in the world, and the projects of which man
undertakes, de Beauvoir provides the definition of a moral freedom and
the case for the development of an ethics of ambiguity is given.


The following is given in the first chapter:

> An ethics of ambiguity will be one which will refuse to deny *a
  priori* that separate existants can, at the same time, be bound to
  each other, that their individual freedoms can forge laws valid for
  all.





* "Emperical or psychological ethis" - "nature" - "indtroducing an
  error" - p 9

- p 26 - estabilishment of projects


- p31 life imprisonment - freedom - facticity

After laying out the fundamentals de Beauvoir moves onto personal
freedom, and what may be considered certain personality archetypes in
the second chapter.  Beginning broadly she explores the individual
beginning in childhood and adolescence, the discovery of subjectivity,
and the beginning of personal choice.  She explores the difference
between the man and the "sub-man," and explores the role of the
serious within the world.

> Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values
  spring.  It is the original condition of all justification of
  existence.
