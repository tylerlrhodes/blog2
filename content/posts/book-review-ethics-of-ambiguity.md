*The Ethics of Ambiguity* is Simone de Beavoir's work detailing a
framework for building an ethics derived from "man's fundamental
ambiguity."

Taking the fundamental ambiguity as a given feature of existence and
existentialism, de Beauvoir pushes forward in a manner allowing some
other fundamental ideas and concepts to be developed and explored.
How are things like value and meaning derived and associated with form
given this ambiguity?

This part of the book for me is probably the most important but
perhaps also the most difficult to grasp at times.  It's with this
foundation in the first chapter that the rest of the book is given its
framework and context for developing an ethics.

The principle value from which the ethics is constructed is freedom.

Within this context de Beauvoir describes common patterns of
existence of individuals and groups, exploring their behavior within
the ethics, with an eye to the oppressor and the oppressed.

De Beauvoir later in the book works through when certain actions are
appropriate or may be considered appropriate:  when does it become
appropriate to become the oppressor?

The book was not easy for me to follow everywhere and part of this was
my unfamiliarity with the language of existentialism.  However the
first chapter introduces the reader to existentialism, and "man's
fundamental ambiguity."

From there it does become easier to read.  De Beauvoir's stereotypes
of certain types of individuals such as the adventurer, passionate
man, serious man, artist and writer provide a context to evaluate
behavior.

After going through the stereotypes of individuals she details "the
positive aspects of ambiguity."  




*The Ethics of Ambiguity* is a book by Simone de Beauvoir delving into
the development of an ethics within the framework of existentialism.
In the book de Beauvoir explores the basics of existentialism
including the fundamental ambiguity of existence.  After briefly
covering existentialism de Beauvoir builds the basics of an ethics
which she bases on what she terms "man's fundamental ambiguity."



The first chapter takes on the task of outlining and defining the
ambiguity and freedom which provide the basis for understanding the
rest of the book.  Since I'm not very familiar with existentialism or
the language used to describe its ideas, my ability to understand some
of the concepts of "being" were stretched.  Reading through the book,
the idea that "man makes himself a lack of being in order that there
may be being," is something that I have to return to and think on
through different sections of the book.  

In the first chapter de Beauvoir lays out the reasons that
existentialism provides a good grounding for developing an ethics, and
she provides the basis for developing an ethics of which freedom is
the primary driver.  Combined with the fundamental ambiguity of man's
existence as a being in the world, and the projects of which man
undertakes, de Beauvoir provides the definition of a moral freedom and
the case for the development of an ethics of ambiguity is given.


The following is given in the first chapter:

> An ethics of ambiguity will be one which will refuse to deny *a
  priori* that separate existants can, at the same time, be bound to
  each other, that their individual freedoms can forge laws valid for
  all.





* "Emperical or psychological ethis" - "nature" - "indtroducing an
  error" - p 9

- p 26 - estabilishment of projects


- p31 life imprisonment - freedom - facticity

After laying out the fundamentals de Beauvoir moves onto personal
freedom, and what may be considered certain personality archetypes in
the second chapter.  Beginning broadly she explores the individual
beginning in childhood and adolescence, the discovery of subjectivity,
and the beginning of personal choice.  She explores the difference
between the man and the "sub-man," and explores the role of the
serious within the world.

> Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values
  spring.  It is the original condition of all justification of
  existence.
