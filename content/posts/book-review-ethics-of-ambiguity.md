*The Ethics of Ambiguity* is a book by Simone de Beauvoir delving into
the development of an ethics within the framework of existentialism.
It is a short book and contains challenging and throught provoking
ideas, as well as an introduction to all of the concepts necessary to
follow along.  

It starts by exploring the concepts of freedom and ambiguity.  To do
this it addresses the nature of being, and of the existence of man,
using the framework of existential thought and language.



> Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values
  spring.  It is the original condition of all justification of
  existence.
