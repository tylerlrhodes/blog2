I want something, which I can afford fairly easily, but in no way
shape or form do I feel that I can justify purchasing it.

That something is a new guitar, and an expensive one.  But I don't
really know which one, I've just got an itch and some money burning a
hole in my pocket.

I am not a great guitar player.  I would say I am closer to
intermediate than beginner.  I already have two guitars.  One of them,
I just got a month ago.  The other one I've had for 15 years or so,
although over the last 6 or 7 years it basically sat in its case.

It was taken out of its case about two months ago, and once again,
playing the guitar has become one of my favorite hobbies.

And unlike many years ago when I last played the guitar (I managed
to accumulate 4 at one point -- and later sold 3 of them), I have
more money at my more advanced age.  Enough where I could basically
buy something pretty nice (not going totally crazy though) and not
have to go anywhere near even thinking about getting it on credit.
And I really want to buy a really nice electric guitar now.

BUT I DON'T NEED IT I JUST WANT IT LOLZ!!!!!

And that simple fact stated above has to this point kept me behaving
rationally.  Or relatively rationally anyway.  But the rationalization
gears are working overtime, everyday, and the internet marketing
machine helps the rationalization gears grind.

But I continue to manage so far, making my plans to practice and have
fun and not acquire.  The rationalization gears also move in reverse,
but without the assistance of the internet marketing machine.  YouTube,
is not very helpful moving the gears in reverse.

But I persist.

I already have 2 great guitars.  And everything I need to play and
sound good.

The guitar that I've had for 15 years or so is a seriously nice
acoustic guitar -- a Taylor 414-CE -- which is really, really nice,
and my skills don't do it justice.  But it sounds great, it plays
great, and I love it when I play it.  I can just pick it up and play
until I really can't anymore, and have a blast, even if it's the same
3 or 4 chords I'm just whacking away at.

It's due for a setup (overdue) and going to get some TLC for the first
time in a while in a month or so.  If I hold it just right it even
developed a little buzz, which makes me sad, and I hope it isn't a
permanent or extremely expensive to fix defect.

The other guitar that I have, and just bought, is a Fender Telecaster.
It is the cheaper one, the Player Series, made in Mexico, but it is a
totally cool guitar.  I got the butterscotch color, with the black
pick guard, and I plug it into my new Line 6 Pod Go, which plugs into my
headphones.  One day, in the hopefully not too distant future, it will
play loudly through a speaker or amp.  But not today (or tomorrow).

The Telecaster, combined with the Pod Go, sounds incredible.  I mean
they really really sound great through the headphones.  There are so
many different configurations and sounds to play around with on the
Pod Go, and I could probably play it for the rest of my life and not
be able to really find all the sounds you can make with the Pod Go.

So I have a great time playing the Telecaster.  Once again I can
hammer away at some chords and find a nice groove, and now, with the
looper (on the Pod Go), I can loop it and then abuse the minor
pentatonic scale pattern for longer than I think is proper.  But it's
fun.  Hell, I even have it plugged into my MacBook and I record the
crap.  I think it sounds awesome.  Add GarageBand to this setup and
it's more than I know what to do with.

So I have all that I need to play, and jam away for fun.

Now, if by chance you ask me how many songs I know how to play (I mean
from start to finish) and you will hear the crickets chirp as I remain
mute.  Um, one -- maybe?

What the hell do you play on the guitar?  Well, I know the 1-4-5 chord
pattern and how to figure out which chord is the 1 and the 4 and the
5, and I just fuck around making shit up most of the time.

Oh and with the looper and a little knowledge of the pentatonic scale,
and the major scale, I could waste all day.  Many many hours have gone
down the tubes in the past month this way.

While with these 2 instruments and some TLC I could be set instrument
wise for the rest of my life, maybe purchasing an amplifier or some
type of speaker to play with other people in the future.

For all practical purposes I am set.

Uh huh.

Right, and just like all other Americans once I'm all set I stop
buying new things.  As the ultimately practical and rational person
that I am -- I do not buy things that do not make total sense for me to
own (I have a nice bridge to sell to you...).  So I will not buy a new
expensive guitar.  It wouldn't be practical.

Which is exactly why I have decided to buy a new expensive guitar.

What else did you think I would end up doing?  Not buy a new guitar?
That would be totally irrational.

Or whatever.

But, I have programmed in a bit of logic to make it as rational as a
human could ever dream of being.

Well, actually, society programmed in the logic for me, having
developed the ritualistic observation of the passage of time, commonly
referred to as a birthday.

And the big number 40 is coming up in a wee bit less than two years.

Which means I have about two years to pick one out.

I have some ideas.  And a lot to learn.
