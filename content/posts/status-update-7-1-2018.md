Well it's time for another blog entry.  I don't have too much to add
at this point, but in the spirit of blogging and writing more, I'll
try to come up with something to write about.

I've been keeping track of my progress in SICP, and so far I'm up to
exercise 1.31.  I started working through the book around 6/16/2018.
So that means I've been at it for about two weeks now and I've done
about 30 of the exercises.  Having skipped a few here and there, that
still adds up to about two a day.  I've read up to around section 2.3.

My guess is that there are probably 350 exercies or so in SICP, if not
more.  I've found that typically I read ahead a bit and try to follow
along in my paperback copy of the book, while using the online edition
to go back and work through the problems.  I've learned a few things
about using Scheme in Dr. Racket, such as how to import other files
into a program, and its been a pretty pleasant experience so far.

I'm still enjoying the book.  It's challenging to go through for
sure.  The last academic-ish work I did was taking an Algorithms
course on Coursera (Algorithms part 1) and I can say for sure that
this book is more challenging.  While I miss the format of having
timed exercises to do which are graded that the Algorithms course
provided (you would upload your Java code and it would test it and
grade it), SICP still seems like a worthwhile challenge.

So if I keep up doing about two exercises a day and there are about
350 problems in the book it should take about six months to work
through.  I have a feeling some of the future exercises may take
substantially longer though -- they aren't getting easier.  I think
it's going to take at least a year to work through this book if I can
keep up the pace.

In other news I've continued to succumb to my book buying addiction.
Part of me thinks I just like to have books.  I've purchased a few in
the last month that will keep me busy for a long time, with the
exception of a few.

I picked up the following books recently:

1. The Little Schemer
2. The Seasoned Schemer
3. Lisp in Small Pieces
4. The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from
First Principles
5. Distributed Systems
6. Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces

So my book buying addiction is alive and well.

There is a Coursera course (2 actually) covering the book "The
Elements of Computing Systems" which I'm going to sign up for in a
month or so.  That's about three or four months of time on Coursera to
make it all the way through, and it will probably slow down the SICP
work a little, but I do plan on doing both in parallel.

I started poking through "The Little Schemer" and it's unique compared
to any other programming text I've had before.  It's written in a
question and answer format.  In fact, the whole text (it's not that
long) is a series of questions followed by answers.  The stated goal
of the book is to teach the reader to think recursively.  I think
between this book and SICP over the next year I'll definitely be
better at doing that.

I couldn't help but buying "Lisp in Small Pieces" as it contains the
implementation for something like 11 or 12 interpreters and a few
compilers.  I think I plan on working through "Essentials of
Programming Languages" first however, afer SICP.

Although I've only been keeping track of my "learning plan" for the
past few weeks, I'm still slacking on the math part of it.  So since I
haven't been going through my old textbooks yet I took some time to
explore what Coursera has.  I was pleased to find that there is now a
specialization in Discrete Mathematics that they offer.  I had a lot
of success working through the Algorithms course previously on
Coursera, and I plan on signing up for this specialization.

So two weeks into tracking my progress I'm about 30 exercies and 120
pages into SICP.

My wallet is also lighter again due to my book buying binges.

Hopefully in another month or so I'll be at least another 30-40
exercies further along in SICP.
