"Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: The Psychological Genesis of
Violence, Evil, and Creativity," is a book by Stephen A. Diamond, a
"licensed clinical and forensic psychologist."  So I have no idea what
that means as far as what Dr. Diamond does in his day job, but it does
sound kind of interesting, and undoubtedly qualifies him to write a
book on this stuff.

Now I basically have totally unrealistic expectations for most things,
but I did kind of expect a book that basically says in its title to
explore the psychological genesis of violence, evil, and creativity,
to, well, maybe offer up what makes us angry beyond a summary of some
"studies."  The more I read, the less I like "studies."

So before going further in this review, I'll say I have a little stake
in this discussion (I mean who doesn't), to the extent that I have
been diagnosed with \*mental illness\* and would love to see a
"cure" for said malady.

I think the studies are bullshit for the most part in this area,
and any group of people who can produce the disaster work that is the
DSM, well, at least your insurance will hopefully cover being able to
talk to someone I guess.

So I'm totally biased:

 * studies = garbage / marketing material
 * psychiatrists = well meaning people who hopefully just don't know
      any better
 * psychologist = well read person with "people skills" (a good listener)
 * diagnosis = total guess and billing code

So to sum up the disaster a little, psychology and psychiatry are
basically relatively new, um, "sciences," (last few hundred years),
and I guess since antiquity when there was basically just "madness" we
now have discovered everything in the DSM, which, of course, continues
to change as "conditions" dictate.

Now, this "scientific medical" field has a little more power than it
potentially should in a lot of matters, but maybe most of all in the
fact that I guess people think they know what they're talking about,
and if the situation ever arises, these folks can say a few words, and
you're freedom disappears while you are "treated."
