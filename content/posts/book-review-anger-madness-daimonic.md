"Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: The Psychological Genesis of
Violence, Evil, and Creativity," is a book by Stephen A. Diamond, a
"licensed clinical and forensic psychologist."  So I have no idea what
that means as far as what Dr. Diamond does in his day job, but it does
sound kind of interesting, and undoubtedly qualifies him to write a
book on this stuff.

The book seems to be written from a clinicians perspective, and
despite being clear and evocative in places, in others it simply
summarizes studies and says little.  There were parts of this book
that I thought were great (I'll get to them) and there were parts that
put me to sleep and made me angry!

Before getting into the review too much, I will say that I am pretty
biased going into this.  But only to the extent that I think
pscyhiatric diagnoses (I have one) are bullshit, and in no way shape
or form agree with the idea that they are the result of genetics.  I
think they are the result of intra and inter personal relationships for
the most part, not genetics and biology per se.

I first read this book before reading anything written by Rene Girard
on mimesis, and his framework for interpreting violence and desire.
Girard, in my opinion, is the more correct interpretation on the
genesis of "anger, madness, and the daimonic," although Diamond's text
is strong and encouraging in general -- despite such a dreary topic.

Part of this book that was ironically encouraging, was that it didn't
cut the *classical* approach for dealing with madness, and holds it up
for a contemporary analysis.  The fact that this book actually
discusses exorcism, and basically says that it kind of works to cure
people from madness, is pretty eye opening.  Especially given that it
comes from the pen of a \*modern\* clinician.
