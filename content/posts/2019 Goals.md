So this post probably should have been written sometime back in
December of 2018, but here we are in late April 2019 and I'm starting
to think about it.

I was home sick the other day and had started this post after
stumbling upon some "digital nomads" site, where the nomad had
described some of his goals for the year.  I thought that it would
probably be a good idea to reflect a little and also plan a little.
So I've written this for 2019, but it's kind of just a loose roadmap
for a year or so.

So I'm just going to list some goals:

* Write 20 blog posts
* Limit to 5 hours a week of *TV*
* Finish the following technical books:
  * Pro SQL Server Internals
  * SQL Server 2017 Query Performance Tuning
  * TSQL Fundamentals
  * Concurrent Programming On Windows
  * Concurrency in .NET
  * Programming Clojure
  * Clojure Applied
  * Get Programming With F#
  * Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)
  * Expert F#
  * Elements of Programming Interviews in Python
  * Pro .NET Memory Management
  * Writing High Performance .NET Code
* Read the following non-technical books:
  * Thinking Fast and Slow
  * Basic Economics
  * The Organization Man
  * Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War
  * Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet
  * Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics
  * Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life
  * The Black Swan
  * The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More
  * The 1-Page Marketing Plan
  * This is Marketing
* Take discrete math course on Coursera
* Be able to jog 5 miles
* Get weight to 180 pounds
* Finish SICP exercises in Clojure/Scheme
* Write Monkey interpreter in F# and Clojure

Now, this is a pretty ambitious list, but based on the last year I
think that it's basically doable provided I cut back on the video
intake.  It's so easy to just start watching Netflix or Prime and the
next thing I know the day is over.  I've started to wake up early in
the morning which has helped with productivity, but of course, even
then it's easy to just put on some stupid show.

I'm already working through seven of the technical books right now (I
tend to work on books in parallel) and one of the non-technical
books, so I definitely think it's possible to finish all of them
within a year.  I'm interested in all of these topics, and I'm excited
about learning Clojure, F# and Python this year and becoming
proficient in all of them.  Finishing SICP with Clojure will be a nice
way to get some practice with the language.

Python has been a great language to pick up, although I'm no where
near expert level with it, it's already been useful.  I've used it to
write a simple blog utility, and can see where it will be helpful to
write simple programs and scripts to accomplish things quickly.

Clojure seems to be a very exciting language to learn, as does F#, and
both of these will tie in nicely with my plans to learn more about PLT
and compilers.  I have some books that are more geared towards Scheme
and SML with regards to writing interpreters and compilers, but I
believe the concepts should be easily transferable to these modern
takes on those languages.

The focus on SQL Server is driven partly by interest and partly by
professional reasons.  My current professional track is being driven
towards .NET and SQL Server, and really getting good at SQL Server
from a performance and query writing perspective should serve me
well.  There are miscellaneous technologies that frequently show up in
job listings for .NET jobs, and SQL Server is one of the more common
denominators that I've seen.  Again, a lot of the knowledge here is
fairly transferable to other RDBMSs as well, and I'll probably play
with Postgres as well.

The focus on performance related topics is mostly driven as a
potential resume differentiator, but it's also interesting to learn
about and will lead to a deeper understanding of .NET and SQL
performance.  The focus on functional programming topics is applicable
to modern C# language idioms and libraries, and it's fairly accepted
that these approaches have a positive impact on writing correct and
readable code.  I have run into professional situations where
misunderstandings of LINQ and performance concerns have led to
resistance in utilizing these techniques. However, learning them more
in depth and developing more effective persuasive techniques to
overcome resistance and help introduce functional concepts to decision
makers will be useful.

Notably absent is any web framework or GUI development on the list.
I'm pretty sure I'm going to use Clojure or F# to develop a blog
commenting system with Postgres, and I'm planning on using some
machine learning to develop an anti-spam system.  I'm leaning towards
using Clojure and ClojureScript with Reagent for the GUI to accomplish
this, which uses React under the covers, so I'll pick up something
there even if Reagent isn't a common technology in job listings (Yes
the books are already in my shopping cart on Amazon for the ML...).

Anyway, despite this being an ambitious list, knowing myself there is
a good chance I'll get distracted and end up reading some of these
books and some other ones.  I am making more of an effort to read more
non-technical books while also cutting back on reading the news as
much as I used to.  I'm in the middle of 'Thinking Fast and Slow'
which is a really interesting book, and the other ones that I've
thumbed throw I'm pretty excited to read.

I'm also close to my goal of getting down to 180 pounds, I managed to
get up to about 225 about six months ago, and I'm down to about 190
now.  The jogging I need to work on, a few years ago I was able to
make it about four miles, but I haven't been doing it at all lately so
it'll take some work to get up to five.

In addition to just reading, the comment system I mentioned, working
through the interviewing prep book, finishing the SICP exercises and
writing the monkey interpreter in F# and Clojure will provide some
real things to work on and keep me busy.

It seems like it will take a long time to get through all of this, and
as always there is way more stuff out there in the tech sphere than
there is time to learn.  I also would at some point be able to have my
own consulting or software product business but this realistically a
fair ways off, so in the mean time some of the learning has to be
optimized towards traditional software development jobs, but the
non-technical books will help here, as will the blogging.

After reading 'The Power of Habit' and also reading some of 'Atomic
Habits' (which I need to finish), being more productive with regards
to this stuff is definitely only made possible by building some better
habits.  Reading these books and general life experience has made it
clear that optimizing to improve and take small positive actions that
compound over time is important to learning and growing any number of
things.  In the same vein, it's clear that limiting the seemingly
small actions wich compound negatively is just as important.  It's
cutting out some of the negative habits which will also allow for
easier acquisition of the positive habits.  I certainly have a lot of
room for improvement, and ironically taking more time away from the
computer allows me to focus better on what I want to do on the
computer.

In fact one of the habits that I need to develop is getting the mail
from my box downstairs which is long overdue.  So on that note ...
