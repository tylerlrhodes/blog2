So this post probably should have been written sometime back in
December of 2018, but here we are in late April 2019 and I'm starting
to think about it.

I'm actually home sick today and I started browsing the internet and
clicked on a link on Hacker News that led to a "digital nomads" site
that was kind of interesting, which kind of spurred me to write some
goals for the year.

So I'm just going to list some goals:

* Write 20 blog posts
* Limit to 5 hours a week of *TV*
* Finish the following technical books:
  * Pro SQL Server Internals
  * SQL Server 2017 Query Performance Tuning
  * TSQL Fundamentals
  * Concurrent Programming On Windows
  * Concurrency in .NET
  * Programming Clojure
  * Clojure Applied
  * Get Programming With F#
  * Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)
* Read the following non-technical books:
  * Thinking Fast and Slow
  * Basic Economics
  * The Organization Man
  * Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War
  * Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet
  * Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics
  * Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life
  * The Black Swan
  * The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More
  * The 1-Page Marketing Plan
  * This is Marketing
* Be able to jog 5 miles
* Get weight to 180 pounds
* Finish SICP exercises in Clojure/Scheme
* Write Monkey interpreter in F# and Clojure

So I think that those are some reasonable goals, even if the list may
be a little bit ambitious.  Being able to read that much will
primarily hinge on cutting back on watching garbage on Netflix and
Amazon Prime.
